7	Supplemental: Notes from Rick about Ghost in London	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	## Explanation\n\nThis are the live notes I took while talking with Rick about the [Ghost in London](https://joshunplugged.com/blogPosts/5). The spelling mistakes and capitalization issues are mostly because I was trying to type them out while on the phone with him, and I decided to leave this as is. Formatting has been edited to highlight parts of the notes, but text has not been edited.\n\nThe last edit in the Google Document was on **June 8, 2019**, roughly two weeks after I first saw the UFO.\n\n## Notes\n\nRick: “You can’t hear anything from inside the shower with water running over your head”\n\n“I was very familiar [note-taking stopped] \n\n“What my experience was in that building relating to you in the building at that particular moment… I could have just been an AirBnB guest and every sound would have been foreign to me…\n“I am a film director who lives there… I’m a long term lodger… I live there for months on end, became friends over two years… I know the sounds, the moans, the groans, and its environment… that also means that I would understand that if someone has a key to the door I would hear that… that is a brass victorian key going inside an 1800s door lock… that is just in general terms… I am just relating to you… my general outside the bathroom experience\n\nInside the bathroom it is irrefutably that you could not have heard any sound outside of the bathroom… if you were standing in the shower\n\n“That’s the inside and outside of what physically oyu might be able to hear inside and outside of the bathroom”\n\n“When I was sitting there… that particular house does have… I am aware that they have had a fair amount of clairvoyant, not dark spirited things.. My point I’m trying to do is give you some background”\n\n“The house, I have met plenty of people, they have, they have a lady who is a clairvoyant… not a giggle give me money and ill get a hold of uncle bob… but she has a very special gift… many people have gone to her… I will never go to her because I dont care”\n\n*“She [the clairvoyant] could sense ‘spirits’ in the house and was very uncomfortable being there because there are so many. Not that they are mean, not that they are dark. Apparently people who are involved with such things have a six sense … is another phrase… they can recognize if they are dangerous or well-being”*\n\n**“Kate has seen a young girl, reanna has seen a young girl… their son tom won’t go into the one bedroom because he got too afraid. A lot of activity is in Kate’s daughters bedroom area. Her daughter’s name is Rhiannon”**\n\n“My first person singular experience that the household owners had with me… I had personal experiences I could not explain because they were too unusual… just something is not the same… something is different that would appear and disappear as quickly as you could think”\n\n“But what I wanted to say to you… that’s the background of the house… a professional clairvoyant recognizes there are well-meaning spirits in the house… there are spirits and figures”\n“So anyway…. Ummm… I was working on the film about young girls in STEM education… the film I was working on is called *[redacted for privacy]*… anyway… soo… you were going in to take a shower and I could hear the water and you in the shower… and then I could hear that by the back door by the bathroom door **not a descriptive word not a descriptive sound more of an esoteric phwwoooo, like a breath, an utterance if you will** and I heard you say ‘Hello’... I think you said it twice while you were in the shower the first was Hello and the second was ‘can I help you’ and then you turned off the water and when you came out you asked me ‘was there calling to me … did someone want in the bathroom or something’ and I absorbed what you said and I already knew there was not but there was no way you could have heard what I heard in the bathroom and I heard it but that it was impossible for you to hear it in the bathroom. It wasn’t gutteral, it wasn’t sharp edges notes, there was no clunk or clang, there was no lights, it was a phwooo,.... It was a breath…. It was a breath… like a whoosh, but like you would visually see if something was ripping past you at speed… the sound a car was make if it was at high speed with no engine… the moving of air… the movement of air. So I told you, when you said, does someone need in the bathroom or something… I said ‘No’... and you were perplexed in your towel and said ‘I heard somebody’ and then I said ‘there was no one there’ and then  I said to you ‘did you ever have any history or are you involved with the church’. To me there is an existing acceptance the closer you are involved in the faith the more you will come into attack spiritually. The closer you try to walk in your faith and learn in a Judeo-Christian view the more the contrary spirits will attack you. When I asked you did you have anything to do with the church are you involved with the church, my observation was that you were under attack. So that had a different slant on it.\n\n“ I wouldn’t have been able to hear you either if the shower was running. So in a bigger picture of things, I would say that the sound you heard was not natural, that it wasn’t of this world,... I’m not being an idiot… my faith is as strong as Billy Grahams… my belief is 100% that way, I accept that there are evil spirits just as there are good spirits… you cant have a whole doctrine of Judeo-Christian teachings from the birht of Christ to the modern day wihtout accepting that there is evil and danger on the other side of the railroad tracks… ti wouldn’t make any sense. YOu cant accept that there is only heaven… heaven itself recognizes there is a hell. So, are there spirits that are roaming around that house… that house is clear back to wordsworths time, that was when … has it been around long enough there are things we cannot explain… absolutely\n\n> “Absolutely I heard it, and I can confirm that you heard something that there is no way you could have heard as quiet as it was outside… it was not a human voice you were responding to, you must have thought you heard a voice… but from the outside it was a supposition that you heard something tangible but what I heard was an utterance, a breath, you see what I’m saying? It’s really important to be clear that you heard in the shower something that was physical asking you a question… but there was no one on the outside asking you a question buddy… you think you heard a human sound I’m telling you it was a breath. Make sense? What you heard wasn’t what I heard, why do that make a difference? Why does that make a difference? Because what you heard was meant for you to hear, not for me to hear. I was just a witness. Does that make sense?”\n\n**[Edit: I cannot help but point out here the resemblance with Rick's statement about the "wind" or utterance sound and the Bible's mentioning of the sound of a rushing wind when the Holy Spirit spoke on Pentacost]**\n\n“You responding, can I help you, hello, was answering a human voice. What I heard was not human, was not structured as English language or foreign language, it was a sound, a utterance. And that did happen. But I remmeber distinctly two separate times, one with the shower running and the second when you turned the shower off and were listening. Me standing on the shower I would not have been able to hear that being very familiar with that house, it was physically impossible to even think that could be and partly that is because the walls are so thick and the way the house is built. So, yes you did hear something, no, it wasn’t anybody on the outside of that door.”\n\n“What is important when you find out, there is something called… one of the… one the holy … cant remember this… one of the main… the sentence you need to be aware of is words of knowledge… I looked at you and you looked at me and I would just be a vessel to tell you something and we saw and heard something completely different “\n\n> Josh: “You are basically saying you observe this as a direct message to me and you were secondary witness”\n\n> “Yes”\n\n“The partner to the crime is confirming that something happened and confirming that what was heard on the outside was not heard on the inside and the house has paranormal, but not meanspirited activity, and has confirmed to you that I am not surprised. We have also confirmed the physicality of the experience and if you did I would have heard it too Josh. The bathroom door is maybe 7 or 8 feet and I am only another 12 feet beyond that I would have at least heard what you heard but I did not hear that. The only one in downstairs was you and me. That makes my opinion much more valid given that physicality of that downstairs experience. Do I feel that was a threat to you? No. No I don’t. Do I feel that it was trying to connect with you for some reason? Yes.”\n\n“There’s a very well-known book, that  chronicles, documents, situations that happend throughout italy where they had divine intervention in life-challengin situations and a lot of the stories focused around one particular priest. Gifts of the holy spirit… one of the gifts is the word of knowledge, which I experienced strangely enough, the word gentle you used is really important”\n	1	9	These are my unedited notes, pulled from Google Docs, with Rick the night I asked him to explain our mutual ghost experience in London.	t	666	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 19:38:53.961+00	2020-08-09 09:01:14.979+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	notes-about-ghost-in-london
12	Identifying Intelligent UFOs	2020-08-02 08:04:00+00	t	\N	An Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) or a Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) refers simply to something in the sky that is unusual and not easily identified. It is often simply a weather balloon, asteroid, a drone, or some bending of light due to a natural phenomena. It is important to keep your cool and a level head if you think you have seen one. Try to eliminate every possible natural thing it could be and do some reading first before conclusively declaring that what you saw was an intelligent UFO. If possible, record it, although typically "they" avoid cameras in a fashion almost reminiscent of occult activity. Your mind is quite limited and so it is important to have a set of tools to help avoid mistakes.\n\nTo identify an intelligent UFO you are looking for:\n\n* *Physics-bypassing flight characteristics*\n* *Unequivocal signs of intelligent "piloting"*\n* *Signs of manipulation of consciousness*\n\nHere is an example of an object exhibiting a lot of highly strange physics defying characteristics and apparent intelligence:\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_2tspVI8rs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n# Physics-Bypassing Flight Characteristics\n\nOur 2020 knowledge of physics is still narrow and limited, although a few physicists would love you to imagine otherwise. When I use the word *physics*, I am referring to our classical models of physics, including both Newtonian and Quantum physics.\n\nI use the phrase *physics-bypassing* to imply that an object seems to "go around" or "avoid" natural effects of our classical model of physics taught in all of our textbooks.\n\n## 1. Bypassing Air Friction\n\nAir causes friction on all objects that pass through. With enough friction, an object either produces a *sonic boom* or *catches fire*. This is the reason that our space vehicles need to be shaped with wings when traveling at low speeds, use parachutes to stop themselves, and need heat-resistant shielding when they enter earth's atmosphere.\n\nSigns an object is bypassing air friction:\n\n**F1.** An UAP that accelerates from a stop to thousands of miles per hour near-instantaneously\n**F2.** An UAP that is going thousands of miles per hour without a sonic boom is bypassing air friction.\n**F3.** An UAP that goes thousands of miles per hour (e.g. crossing the entire sky in less than a second) should burst into flames.\n\n## 2. Bypassing Conservation of Momentum\n\nConservation of momentum is the reason that football players get concussions. When the human body stops suddenly, the brain - which is soft - tries to keep moving in the same direction it was going before. This causes it to crash against the skull and produce brusing, which results in a conscussion. The same thing happens when we are in a car that stops or turns too quickly. Our bodies will continue to move the same direction and at the same speed despite what our car was doing.\n\nSigns an object is bypassing conservation of momentum:\n\n**M1.** An UAP that instantaneously changes direction without slowing down (e.g. moves in a zig-zag pattern across the sky or turns at a right-angle without any loss of speed)\n\n## 3. Bypassing Strong Nuclear Force\n\nThe strong nuclear force holds quantum particles together, and likewise resists the approach of other nuclear particles. It is what gives solids, liquids, and gasses their characteristics.\n\nIn many UAP reports, the objects appear to move through solids or liquids with characteristics we can only dream about.\n\n**N1.** An UAP enters and exits water without loss of speed\n**N2.** An UAP moves through a solid object without any apparent harm to itself (although it might leave residual harm on the object it passed through)\n**N3.** An UAP rests partially overlapping with a solid object\n\n## 4. Bypassing Lightwave Characteristics\n\nOur standard experience of light is that it is reflected off of objects that exist, some of the photons are directed toward our eyeballs retina, and then we see the object at the location where it exists. Any behavior that seems to break this model of our experience with light is strong evidence what you are observing might be an intelligently-piloted UAP.\n\n**L1.** An UAP vanishes and/or appears without its light being blocked by an object\n**L2.** An UAP splits into multiple pieces and then reforms its original shape\n**L3.** An UAP morphs its shape (e.g. like a bacteria in a petri dish)\n**L4.** An UAP is surrounded by or emits a halo of glowing light\n**L5.** An UAP appears to be slightly transluscent, revealing portions of what is behind it\n\n# Unequivocal Signs of Intelligent "Piloting"\n\nIntelligence is the ability of an object to respond to sensory information and make decisions accordingly. A meteor does not know to change directions to avoid a mountain, but an intelligently piloted craft would.\n\n**I1.** An UAP turns to avoid a physical object\n**I2.** An UAP vanishes as soon as person sees it\n**I3.** An UAP returns to be seen again when a person performs a spiritual exercise like prayer\n**I4.** An UAP moves to a location it could not have known without information only humans would have known (e.g. the UAP that moved ahead of the F-18 aircraft to their next checkpoint)\n\n# Signs of Manipulation of Consciousness\n\nThere is strong overlap between the characteristics of UAP and some religious experiences with the craft. For example, the [miracle of Fatima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun) has many characteristics that other UFO reports throughout history have. Manipulation of conscious experience means that it appears that something is playing with the senses or minds of people or animals.\n\n**C1.** The presence of a UAP is strongly correlated with highly unusual animal activity\n**C2.** The presence of a UAP is observed in the same location by multiple people, but they saw different colors, shapes, or had highly different residual emotions from the event\n**C3.** The presence of a UAP causes an unusually high fear response in an observer\n**C4.** The presence of a UAP is associated with crystal-clear voices in the head of an observer\n\nClearly at this point we are entering the realm of religious experience and the occult, and it is for this reason that I agree with Jacques Vallée that UFO/UAP phenomena appears to be one and the same with other paranormal activity and exhibits high "trickster" content.	\N	\N	People often ask how to identify a UFO/UAP.

3	Childhood, Spiritual Dreams, and Dark Presence	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	# Early Christian Life\n\nI grew up in a conservative, midwestern, protestant, reformed Christian household. For the most part I remember loving it, and presuming that the things I was taught were true. We had the truth, we were happy, and the rest of the world was lost in sin and going to hell. It was a simple perspective.\n \nMy earliest days in the church were deep and spirit-filled. I can remember one Sunday when I first understood the basics of the classical protestant gospel. I must have been around the age of seven. Christ was the replacement for me and His love was the foundation for my life. Upon this realization, I sang out in church like I had never sung before until an older lady behind me congratulated me on my strong singing voice.\n\nLater, I remember reading in the Bible about Solomon asking for wisdom and I told God that I too wanted wisdom in life. I was sincere in this prayer, but I was not really sure what I was asking.\n\nOn another day when I was probably ten, I had a dream in which I saw Jesus. In my dream, I was on a river bank near a park and was playing with neighborhood children. On the embankment there was a small blacksmith where the devil lived. There was a line drawn on the ground between the park and the devil’s workshop. If any of us children crossed the line the devil could come catch us and do whatever he wanted to us, but he was not allowed to come into the park. Rather foolishly, I enjoyed teasing the devil by crossing the line into his territory, waiting for him to chase me, and then running back across the line back into the park right before he would catch me. Each time he would sulk back to his blacksmith more and more enraged.\n\nIn my dream we were allowed to play as we wanted until sundown, but I intuitively knew that after sundown the devil could cross this barrier line into the park. My justification for this was that teasing the devil was fun and surely we would go home before sundown so I was at little risk of actually getting caught. But as you can imagine, sundown came suddenly, and I could see the devil walking straight toward me and with an evil grin on his face he stepped over the line that had kept me safe and grabbed me. I was quite terrified.\n\nAs he grabbed me, my dad ran over and began arguing with the devil to let me go. The devil stated that the law clearly said that he was allowed to cross over the line to come and grab whoever he wanted after sundown, and since I had been teasing him so much, he wanted me. Somehow I knew that the devil was right.\n\nAt this point the dream transformed. It was dark, very dark, and it was just the three of us: me, the devil, and some man facing away from me. The man’s shirt was off and his back was bloody, as if sweating drops of blood, and I could not see his face. I heard him say to the devil, “Don’t take Josh, take me instead”. And then I awoke.\n\nOne day I went to my dad and asked him the classic question **“Dad, how do we know our version of religion is the correct one?”** My dad responded by pointing to some apologetics books and telling me that smarter men than both of us had studied this intensely and concluded that the resurrection of Christ did actually happen. After a brief attempt to comprehend what Josh McDowell was saying in the classic book Evidence that Demands a Verdict, I concluded that I was just going to have to trust that the apologists were right. And I was very thankful for their hard work and a small seed was planted that maybe someday I too could learn enough to be like them.\n\nFor a couple years, all was fairly normal. I had a happy childhood and my parents were doing well to raise us as good Christian children. Then as I entered my teens the darkness started, and it was not a normal adolescence.\n\nMy dad’s cousin Anastasia was killed by a bullet to her head in the middle of a cemetery in Kansas City in what appeared to be some sort of pre-planned Satanic sacrifice when I was around maybe 10 years old. Her funeral was bristling with spiritual heaviness. There was a solid divide between the funeral attendees. On the one side were many Christians and on the other were the members of Anastasia’s group of “friends”. Her friends were all heavily dressed in gothic attire and hovered around a man who seemed to be their ringleader. He was attractive, smiling far too much for a funeral, and surrounded himself with young women. The atmosphere at the funeral was surreal and there was a palpable sense of evil that even I, at that young age, could feel. I distinctly remember some of the girls giggled and smiled as they walked away from viewing Anastasia in the casket.\n\nAs the ceremony was getting ready to start, I sat down near the back of the sanctuary on a pew by myself waiting while others were talking. The ringleader was about three pews in front of me, and seemed to enjoy his friends who were seating themselves around him. As I looked at the back of his head I was thinking “that man seems to be very evil”. Instantly, he turned around and stared straight at me. At first I thought that he must have been looking at someone behind me, so I turned around and there was nobody there. So I looked back, and he was staring at me and he shrugged as if to say “what do you want?” Dread crept over me. Somehow he seemed to know I was thinking about him while he was looking the other way. Who told him? Did anything tell him? This was too creepy. I shrunk down into my pew seat while he continued to stare at me. Finally he turned around.\n\nShortly after, although I cannot 100% correlate it to this incident, I began to be filled with horrid doubt about hell and whether I was actually a Christian. Every time a preacher did a classic “altar call” I was seized with fear. Each time a preacher would give communion and talk about taking the body and blood of the Lord I would have a full-blown panic attack. These panic attacks continued for years, hundreds of times, until eventually I could barely sleep. I would have waking nightmares where I was almost asleep, but not quite, and in my spiritual eye I could see Satan in front of me, staring me down. Then I began to experience an evil presence in my room when I was generally going to sleep. It was there, just watching me.\n\nI went to pastors and elders and other spiritual leaders dozens of times to discuss this and unfortunately never got any permanent answer as to what was going on. They all told me that it appeared from my life that I was bearing fruit for Christ and I was probably being attacked with doubts by Satan and I should pray and trust God. Sometimes I was told this must be happening because of some hidden sin or arrogance on my part. These suggestions drove me deeper into despair.\n\n## A Prophetic Key Dream (roughly age 14)\n\n> Around this time I had another spiritual dream. In my dream it was pitch black, very similar to the darkness in the show The Stranger Things when the demogorgon would appear. It felt like the absence of God. **Out of the darkness a grotesque face of a dog appeared, lunging straight at my face. Just as it was in front of my face, I heard a metalic snap and saw that it was on a chain.** I awoke in terror and a small voice said “Josh, no matter how far the devil may go, he can only go so far”.\n\nI kept hoping and praying, over and over, that God had a plan for this time in my life, because I could see nothing good could come of this depressing period.\n\n## Growing Up\n\nOne time I told God I was going to flip a coin five times and if it was all heads all five times, then I would know I was “saved”. Five heads later, I was shocked at the result yet somehow the darkness prevailed and the doubts still did not go away. Eventually I just learned to ignore the sinking doubts and force myself to live a Christian life and put on a smile.\n\nAs I approached twenty, I was quite involved in teaching several Bible studies and even leading some people to become Christians. At this point I had completely read the entire Bible a dozen times. But as the dark presence became less common and I learned to ignore doubts about salvation, my doubts now shifted into questions about doctrines and the foundations of the Christian faith. In a way, I began revisiting the question I had asked my dad when he pointed me to apologetics. How was it that so many churches were so different if there is no division in Christ? Why were some churches focused heavily on the Spirit and others were focused on doctrines and creeds? If the Holy Spirit is found in all believers, why did the organization of all believers seem so chaotic? If the Bible is the Word of God, why was the interpretation of it so messy across the thousands of denominations in the Christian church? What about evolution? What about the paranormal experiences of other denominations and even churches? What about atheism?\n\nAtheism perplexed me the most.\n	1	2	My early childhood years were normal, except for a series of dreams and spiritual experiences that deeply defined my view of the world.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 18:38:29.172+00	2020-08-09 09:02:02.973+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	childhood-spiritual-dreams-dark-presence
9	The UFO Leads to "Deliverance"	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	## Some Background History\n\n*The Gospel of Matthew Chapter 2:*\n\n"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men [literally sorcerers, linked potentially to Zoroastrianism] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? **For we saw his star when it rose** and have come to worship him.” When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:\n\n“‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”\n\nThen Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” After listening to the king, they went on their way. **And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.** When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way."\n\n## The UFO Keeps Reappearing\n\nOne day near the end of July I remember coming home, and going out on my balcony late at night in Hägersten to smoke a cigarette. The sky never quite gets fully dark in Sweden in the summer, so it was still slightly blue. As I stepped outside I noticed a rather bright star. Looking more closely, I noticed it was moving very slowly but at a fixed rate, about the speed of a drifting balloon. It was a single point of bright light, brighter than any star I had ever seen. One second after I noticed it was moving, it faded away gently and disappeared. “What the heck did I just see?”\n\nEvery day I was experiencing what felt like a battle around me. When I would come home I would feel the presence of angels now guarding my apartment building rather than the dark presence I had felt before. Dark presences were there, they were just in the background. \n\nMy notes from this time:\n\n> “On some occasions I feel a dark presence, an overwhelming sensation of blackness and hatred. But not like the demonic presence in my room. It is an external weight, and even makes me feel ill. On one occasion I heard demons in my spirit scream at me “we hate you, we will kill you.” I have asked why, and they reply “we are permitted to torment you.” I once replied firmly “do your worst.” And they have been.”\n\nOne particularly difficult night I remember walking to buy cigarettes, and as I walked back through a tunnel, alone, I saw a man I had never seen approaching me. Something felt off about him. As he passed me, coming from the direction of my apartment, I could see his face was twisted into a grotesque and furious shape, as if he was about to kill someone, and he stared straight at me as he walked by. If there were demons, they were sure all aware of what was going on.\n\nIn these days, the star would appear again often when I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette - often in a different location and at varying intensities - but I took it every time as a gentle reminder that I was being watched and that I was not abandoned. Every single time I saw it, it would gently disappear as if acknowledging that I noticed it. It became commonplace, but each time I saw it I would feel an overwhelming sensation of awe and presence.\n\nAt this point, I was still thinking that I was onto some deeper, magical understanding of the universe that maybe nobody else had reached. After all, nobody I knew had experienced ghosts talking to them, UFOs, and demons and angels warring in their apartment all at the same time. I was not ready to adopt any particular views on sin, or church, or theology, or doctrines and for a while thought that maybe I was one of only a handful of people in the world who had a clue what might be going on - but even I was unbelievably confused.\n\nOne day I got an urge, as if something was screaming at my soul: “go to church”. I ignored it. I had had enough of church, I wanted God in my life through paranormal experiences. Church was full of ridiculous theology and arguments about doctrines and creeds. I wanted the real thing. Besides, what church would I go to? What churches have theologies about stars in the sky guiding people and demon-possessed subway dwellers snarling at you as you walk by them?\n\nA week later on Sunday, the voice yelled “go to church!” so strongly that I remember watching my legs move in front of me as I got dressed and left my apartment to go to church for the first time in only God knew how long.\n\nAt this point in time the only church I knew in Sweden was the one my friend Mari, the first person I met in Sweden, attended. I was so embarrassed asking her! I had come to Sweden announcing how ridiculous religion was and how adamantly atheist I was and how ridiculous all theology and supernatural experiences were and here I was messaging the only Christian I knew in Sweden to ask her if I could go to church with her.\n\nThat experience of walking up to the chapel is one I will never forget. About 20 meters from the entrance, I was surprised to feel the presence of angels, and they were singing - almost laughing with joy. It felt as if they were singing “we got you!” The verses came to my mind about how the angels rejoice when one sinner repents.\n\nIronically, when I entered church I saw that an old friend who was known living the playboy life was there too. Two of us? “Wow, Matt, how long have you been coming here?” “A couple of months, I just started. Felt like something was missing.” He alluded to some experience back in late 2018 that scared him so much he felt he had to get his life right.\n\nThat night we had dinner and I told our little church attendee group all about my ghost experience, but did not tell them anything about the star or the dark presence. There were so many strange paranormal experiences during this time that it would take a volume to write about them, including strange smells, a friend from Spotify telling me she could see a white aura “like a whirlwind” around me, and a picture that had never budged falling off of my wall after I felt an angel nudge me to stop drinking so much.\n\nNow at this point even though I had seen the two ufos with my friend and I had also seen the “star” fade away a couple more times, I was not convinced it was anything supernatural and was thinking maybe I was seeing satellites or really slow shooting stars. I mean, perhaps this was all in my head and I was connecting things together, despite the religious “feelings” I had, in ways that were not rational. **It occurred to me one day walking home that the only way I could know if it was supernatural was if it moved in an impossible fashion, like darting across the sky.**\n\nThe very next night I saw it again. My text messages to my friend Adrien from this time:\n\n> “Aug 4, 2019 23:30. Just saw my third ufo. Small star that was moving that as soon as I looked at it started to disappear. So I looked away and then looked back at it and it lit up again. Then it started to fade and then zipped away at amazing speed, faster than anything Ive seen. I got goosebumps and then got terrified. Heart started to beat insanely fast.”\n\n*(Note: at this point in time I told Adrien I had seen it only three times, because I was not “sure” about a few of the sightings I had had. The reality is that I had probably seen it 5-6 times at this point but was being conservative in my estimate. I still was not sure what I was seeing.)*\n\n**The star faded out twice, while moving, each time exactly as I looked at it. Then the third time I looked it accelerated exponentially down toward the horizon, faster than I had ever seen anything move in my life. Each time its appearance and fading was directly timed to when I looked.**\n\nAround this same time I briefly dated a woman who I will call Sally. Due to all the failures in the past and my ridiculous selfish tendencies, I blew things up but this time in extraordinary fashion as soon as I started liking her. One night feeling a pain of failure I walked home and it felt as if the angels had completely abandoned me. For the first time in months as I entered my apartment it felt spiritually abandoned and I begged God to give me a sign he was still there. Out on my balcony I saw the star again, but even in that moment I felt so alone it barely affected me. You might wonder how in the world a person could experience something like this and not be affected, but the truth is that spiritual presence or lack of it can blind you to any miracle. What had I done wrong? Also, what in the world was this star doing? Could it maybe give me a clearer message?\n\nOver the next few days, God made it clear to me that my mistake was my fear to be open about what was going on in my spiritual life. It was not wrong for me to be attracted to her or even date her, but it was wrong for me to put my desire to be liked before God’s plan. I was afraid that telling about what was happening would scare this girl away so I was trying to be my old self. So I had been given over to screwing things up.\n\nI promised God that if I had a chance, I would apologize to Sally for my mistake and then open up to her gently about my newfound faith. Sure enough, a chance presented itself and Sally opens up, drunk, about how she felt she had a hole in her chest, she was taking depression medication, and while all she wanted to do was go home and be alone she felt compelled to be out drinking and dancing with men. In the past I would have pontificated about mental illness and finding a good therapist, but for a brief moment I recognized demonic oppression since I had been experiencing it too.\n\n## The "Deliverance" Message\n\nThat night I walked home and felt the presence of the angels, and I tried to pray for Sally. No words came to me. I did not know how to pray for her, so I asked God to help me. Here are my notes from a few days after this experience:\n\n> “I have been praying for Sally, every day. God told me to pray for “deliverance”. That was the word given to me. My prayer is that she is delivered from the demon tormenting her and the pain it is causing, the “hole in her chest” she has explained over and over. She knows I am praying for her, and I will continue - even though she obviously thinks it is nuts.”\n\nThe word given to me was deliverance. I had probably not said that word in over ten years. It was very, very strange. I remember asking the angel “deliverance from what?” After all, it was obvious that everyone needs deliverance, but I felt this had a double meaning. Maybe Sally had some secret she was hiding?\n\n**Then one night I remember complaining to God about this stupid star in the sky. How was this helping me? After all, a star does not exactly spell any messages in the sky. Would it not be easier if the star left a note or something? Why is this all so mystical and cryptic? I was getting upset with God, to be honest.**\n\nI had been searching for any other events in history, or on YouTube or anywhere that involved a star in the sky like this. In all my Christian life I had never heard of someone seeing a star and having it being connected with angelic presence. **But in my searching I could only find one story: the magi in the gospels.** Typically, scientists have tried to explain the Magi star in the sky as some sort of astronomical alignment. But in the text the star “appears” and they begin following it. This does not make sense if it was a fixed star because the text says that it “moved” ahead of them and that it stopped over the place where Jesus was born. Then it says the magi were “overjoyed” when they saw it - after they had already been following it for a long distance! If the star was a fixed point in the sky, why did it say they were overjoyed at seeing it after they had already seen it? Because it was disappearing, moving, and reappearing. Even weirder, Herod asked them when the star appeared. Could they not just go outside with him and point? Obviously they were the only ones who were seeing it. Just like my star.\n\nGiven this was the only story I could find, I announced to my friend John one day in October that I was going to follow the star. I learned by this point not to do something until I got clearer signs from angels so that I did not make a mistake.\n\n> “Angels, if you want me to follow this star please make it move again and I will follow.”\n\nNext time I went out to look which was a Thursday (I believe it was shortly before September 27, 2019 based on my text messages at the time), I looked and looked, and saw nothing. I was disappointed. Maybe I was not supposed to follow it. As I was about to give up and walk back inside, I saw it dart to nearly the same location it had the former time! Gotcha!\n\nHeart racing, I quickly grabbed my iPhone and opened my map and checked my compass. The star had darted down toward the horizon just a little bit to the right of the tip of a crane that was parked to the North of my apartment, which was about 10 degrees to the left of north. I started scrolling that direction on Google Maps, seeing nothing. After scrolling about 7km I saw the words “New Life” appear on the screen. This is odd for Stockholm, where most places are named in Swedish.\n\nClicking it, I discovered it was a church. It had services on Sunday at 10am and it had a 4.9 star rating. So I texted John that I was going to go. **He, probably weirded out, did not offer much of a response. But I had learned that if God or His angels give you even the smallest of breadcrumbs you must follow them.**\n\nBrowsing their website, I discovered that New Life church was one of only a handful of English speaking churches in Stockholm, so that was good. Thankfully the angels did not take me somewhere unintelligible. The church seemed somewhat charismatic so this was different than my youth, but given my experiences I was quite relieved. They did not seem to be a crazy healing church or anything.\n\nThat Sunday, as I sat in the chair near the back I remember wondering how in the world I was going to explain things when someone would inevitably ask me “so what brought you to New Life?” “Oh, you know, just followed a star in the sky, as one does.” They asked if there were any first-timers. I raised my hand and was given a guest card. This was going to be hard to explain during their “welcome” session after the service.\n\nI was surprised to discover New Life was hosting a traveling preacher that weekend. The preacher explained how he and his wife were involved in helping people with spiritual warfare. This was - timely. Then he announced that he was having a three part series on spiritual warfare starting the very next day, and it would go from October 7-9. I shuffled with nervous anticipation in my chair.\n\nWhen I arrived on Monday, I found a seat and waited. People milled about and we sang a few songs. Then the preacher got up to give his message and on his Powerpoint presentation, on a stark blue background in bright white letters, one word was written across the screen:\n\n![Deliverance on Powerpoint](https://joshoncode.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bdd7f2ceb1c7481992c9c93b4f0deb7e.JPG)\n\nI was so shocked that I took a picture. This was too real, too deeply real. This was the word I had written in my journal that the angel had, without explanation, given me weeks before. All the pieces fell into place like a jigsaw puzzle. That day I got the distinct impression that I probably would never see the star ever again, because it had served its purpose and nearly a month later I have not seen it once and I do not believe I will see it again.\n\n[In my earliest story blog post I mentioned a Crazy Prayer I prayed shortly before becoming an atheist over ten years before.](https://joshunplugged.com/blogPosts/4) The prayer went like this:\n\n> “God, I want to be able to reach even the most stubborn atheist, but I do not know how because I do not know what it is like to be one. I am willing to even become an atheist if it will help me reach them for you.”\n	1	7	The UFO finally makes sense, and I follow it and see where it leads.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 20:41:03.433+00	2020-08-09 09:00:54.015+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	ufo-leads-to-deliverance

4	Reasoning my Way to Atheism	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	## Following the Evidence\n\nAround 2007 after a brief stint in Denver, I sidetracked from a computer science career to attend Moody Bible Institute in Chicago - looking primarily for apologetical answers. All I needed to do was to apply the principle that *all truth is God’s truth* and *follow the evidence wherever it lead*. Naturally everything from philosophy to science to theology to spiritualism would, when studied in depth, lead back to the One True Faith.\n\nAt this point the dark presence would only occasionally appear and I had learned to ignore it. But my arrival in Chicago was met with a dark and evil presence stronger than any I had experienced back in Wichita or Denver. I can distinctly remember a moment in my Chicago dorm room. Normally when I would feel the dark presence, it would hover near me, just watching, usually for five to ten minutes. But in Chicago, I remember feeling that it was a different type of presence like a more powerful being. And strangely, when it noticed that I was aware of it, I felt it instantly hide itself and the dark feeling vanished. “That was odd”, I thought. “Why did this presence not want to be seen?” That had never happened before.\n\nIt might be worth noting at this point that the feeling of this dark presence was almost always when I was alone, during a mixture of waking and sleeping, and if I left the room where I felt it and then returned it would still be there. It was not sleep paralysis as best I can tell, because one time I even went and got my dad and brought him back to check it out. But was it all in my head? I had never had any audible or visual hallucinations.\n\nAs best I could tell, there were only three possibilities to my supernatural experiences:\n\n1. All the spiritual experiences had some basis in reality\n2. Some of the spiritual experiences were real and others were in my head\n3. All the spiritual experiences were in my head\n\nHow can we know which spiritual experiences are in someone’s head and which ones are real? This question perplexed me.\n\nSometimes other Christians would say they experienced similar things. They would occasionally share stories about a house being haunted, or people hearing demonic voices but these stories almost all tended to come from remote places like Africa or South America where witchcraft was regularly practiced. People would talk about missionaries who had photos that seemed to show dark auras around the spiritually oppressed. Can we trust these stories?\n\nAround this time an ethical dilemma occurred to me. The golden rule states that we should do unto others as we want them do unto us. Jesus - [echoing Confucious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) - even hinted this was a foundational principle of all morality. If I wanted people to study Christianity to such and such an extent, should I not study their views just as much in depth? If I wanted an atheist to read all the apologetics books, should I not learn all about biology and history and astronomy and archeology?\n\nAs I indulged myself in studying and questioning, I absorbed philosophy, history, logic, and more like a sponge while at Moody Bible Institute, way beyond what classes required. I read most of the ancient apocrypha (Book of Enoch, Jubilees, the "lost" gospels, etc.), studied evolution and biology, listened to hundreds of debates with Christians on every topic imaginable, and read countless books and papers by famous apologists and scientists and atheists like Bertrand Russell, Hitchens, Sam Harris, etc. I consumed every book C.S.Lewis had ever written, got to hear the apologist Josh McDowell in person, read about various views of the Christian fathers, and studied the arguments against most of the Biblical prophecies. I watched easily over a thousand YouTube videos trying to find a single video - just one! - with convincing evidence of anything supernatural and was always left disappointed. The more I studied the more concerned I became about faith. Every faith claim seemed to be based on a shaky foundation.\n\n## The Crazy Prayer\n\n> At this time I prayed what would probably become one of the most important prayers of my life. It also has proven to be probably the most reckless and wild prayer I would ever pray. For the sake of my story, I will hide what the prayer was because for the next ten years of my life I nearly forgot about it because I thought it was irrelevant to what followed. Near the end of this story I will share what it was.\n\n## Christian Response\n\nAs my knowledge increased, I became embarrassed at how poorly Christians would respond to the deep questions about the faith. The best questions would come from scientific atheists. In my opinion they would put most Christians, even Christian apologists, to shame. In some cases, like with Dan Barker, they were former Christian preachers themselves (I even met Dan Barker once in Chicago). The skeptics, especially men like Christopher Hitchens and Matt Dillahunty (whom I also met in Wichita), always seemed to come out ahead.\n\nTo my embarrassment, *Christians tended to sneak emotional arguments into every logical discussion*. When asked a direct question about a Bible contradiction, most Christians would, like clockwork, say that a “proper” understanding of the context would clear things up. Then when pressed deeply on what the “proper” context was given that the texts had transmission errors, most Christian apologists would say we cannot know all the details of the time in which the text was written so we have to just trust that it was inspired in the original manuscripts. Then when an atheist would ask where the original manuscripts were, Christians would say - almost as if hiding the cookie behind your back would convince your mom you did not take it - “well, we don’t have them”. I began to agree completely with [Bart Ehrman's research](https://ehrmanblog.org/).\n\nBut surely there must be something behind all the Christian experiences! People like Dwight Moody, Augustine, C.S. Lewis, Bonhoeffer, and Polkinghorne fascinated me because they were able to maintain a spiritual perspective and inspire many people while also somehow not requiring the Bible to be perfect in every way. Strangely many conservative Christians would say they loved these men for their fruit and contributions to the church but “their theology needs help”. It all seemed so arrogant to me and confused. **The most effective and balanced Christians seemed to be the least dogmatic about most theological points.**\n\nOne day I was in the elevator at college. This particular car had a broken “close door” button. A kid rushed in the elevator and, as usual, the door stayed open. This kid started pressing the “close door” button over and over. In my head I was thinking “this is so stupid, the door is just going to close anyway”. And to my horror, I realized this is just like prayer. Prayer is just as dumb as pressing a broken close door button in an elevator. The prayer will probably be answered anyway - even if you don't press the button and actually say the prayer. *Is prayer a broken close door elevator button?*\n\nOver the next month or two, I spent time carefully and analytically testing every aspect of my faith with logic and reason, and my faith was failing repeatedly. As I studied other world religions, I discovered that some of the greatest examples of modern miracles with thousands of witnesses were within the Catholic church. But as good protestants, we believed most Catholics were wrong about nearly every important doctrine. And then I discovered the miracles in Islam, Hinduism, animism, and more. **One key detail emerged: people normally interpreted every supernatural event through the lens of what they already believed.** If a person has their mind primed to believe in haunted houses, they seemed to be more likely to believe they experienced a supernatural event in a haunted house. If we are to be ethical in our interpretation of the world, we should probably interpret miraculous events equally rather than giving favor to the paranormal events that fit what we already believe. The best spiritual or paranormal events, then, are the ones which contradict what we believe. For example, people who do not believe in aliens but then get abducted. These stories, I found, were equally as believable as the Bible stories.\n\n## Embracing Atheism\n\nMy head was spinning and I knew something had to give. I will spare you the details of discovering hundreds, if not thousands, of Biblical discrepancies. Eventually at the age of 23 I knew I had to make what I thought was the most important decision in my life: was I still a Christian?\n\n> At this point, I could not stand before a group of Christians and tell them with confidence that their faith was **true**, because I was discovering that the evidence was just not good enough and the idea of **true** is so relative depending on which Christian you talk to.\n\nOne day I woke up, broken but hopeful, and switched my status on Facebook from Christian to atheist.\n\nSome of the most vitriolic attacks I received were from Christians. If this had been the middle ages, I felt they would have burned me at the stake. But the thing I was still testing for was the existence of the Holy Spirit. It occurred to me that if the Holy Spirit really existed, I should be able to see some consistency in how Christians were interacting with me. After all, if they had the Holy Spirit inside of them, perhaps at least one of them would be able to tell me something extraordinary? If a single God really wanted me, he would give me the same message through more than one Christian. Instead, the responses I got were so… all over the place. Either so few "Christians" were really connected with God, or God clearly was a construct of their imaginations. I was leaning toward the latter.\n\nI debated and spoke with hundreds of Christians, trying to be gentle, compassionate, and logical. The more consistently I was attacked, the more angry I became. Eventually it turned into bitterness and I would attack back. Christians were liars who believed in a false hope and my attempts to find the truth were rejected by them because I was threatening to take away their spiritual toys! **I believed that there was absolutely no good evidence for anything supernatural, even though I wanted parts of it to be true.** And now the target of my knowledge, mirroring the New Atheists of the time like Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins, was all religious people. *I felt duped and deceived by the church and that if I had never had my brain filled with all this junk about hell and demons then I would have never suffered the depression and dark presence in the first place.* After all, if your brain is never filled with a supernatural idea, and supernatural is just a figment of our imaginations, then nothing supernatural cannot possibly affect you, right?\n\nAround this time I had an intense spiritual dream where my body was being consumed and filled by a demon. It slowly moved throughout my chest and lower body, filling my arms and legs and eventually reaching up my neck and into my throat and mouth. As it took over my mind, almost in a terminator fashion, I nearly cried out. Then I awoke. Sweating and heart beating, I calmed down as I took in the morning sun streaming into my Chicago apartment. **Thank God, it was just a dream! Clearly one more example of how toxic religious belief is! If I had never been taught anything religious, I would obviously have never had a ridiculous dream like this.**\n\nFor the next ten years while an atheist, I do not remember any spiritual experiences. No voices, no dark presences, no panic attacks, and no doubts about going to hell. Just complete radio silence for anything remotely paranormal.\n\nI dove into my atheist life with two goals: catch up on all the sinning I was missing out on and overcome all the psychological "garbage" from Christianity. I wanted to be a happy and free atheist, living life free of any supernatural mental trappings. I became a humanist and was excited to be able to try and live a moral life without any gods and finally free of all these bad spiritual experiences. During this time I even attended therapists and went on a retreat with [Marlene Winnell](https://marlenewinell.net/) who specialized in rescuing people from fundamentalist thinking.\n\nAfter deleting Facebook and creating a new account, I swapped to a new secular friend group and pushed myself hard into my career as a computer science major.\n\n> During this atheist time, I did have one rule for myself: I hated lying and deception.\n\nThe thing that led me away from supernatural belief was a devotion to the truth. If I lied, it would be an abandonment of that principle. Yes, I did sometimes hide things, but if pressed directly I would always try to tell the truth. This lead to a catch-22 when talking to Christians who held strict doctrinal positions on “falling away”. For those who are not initiated, there has been a long-standing debate in the church about whether a "true" Christian can actually leave the faith. When I told Christians that I once believed and now I did not, they would reply by telling me I was lying. Obviously no "true" believer would leave, right?\n\nMy career and friendships outside the faith grew while my relationship with my family fell apart. They were all Christians and I was a rebel atheist. They, bless them, had no idea how to deal with me and for the most part moved on with their lives after desperately trying to convince me I was wrong. To be fair, I was probably a nightmare but it hurt tremendously that nobody was honest enough to admit that I had some good points. I felt unbelievably alone, and even more alone as I discovered some sins that many Christians were committing and hiding from others. It all seemed so fake. This is what everyone outside the faith saw when they were looking in. It made me sad that I had tried so hard to live the Christian life when most of them did it for show.\n\nBut in all this I still left a door open to the supernatural. My devotion to the truth meant that if someone - or something - could give me a scientific supernatural event then I would be willing to accept it. After all, my rejection of the supernatural was for logical reasons and therefore a logical reason could bring me back.\n\nSo I said one of my final prayers before embracing atheism fully:\n\n> **“God, or aliens or whatever you might be, I have studied diligently and see no reason that you or anything like you exists, but if you do can you please give me a sign that passes some scientific rigor? I do not trust visions or dreams or anything that could only happen inside of my head. I need something external and verifiable.”**\n\nFor roughly eight years I lifed in Chicago in this new life, trying to adapt to a secular world.\n\nAfter a failed and depressing year and a half attempt to restore my relationship (e.g. try to get them to accept my atheism) with my Christian family by moving back to Wichita, Kansas around 2015, I was one of the few who, on the day Donald Trump got elected, decided to accept a job offer in Sweden. Sweden was in the news as being a happy secular country and I figured it was worth a shot. But something was about to happen that would change my life...\n	1	3	After years of intense study, I joined the New Atheists and rejected my upbringing.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 19:11:42.332+00	2020-08-09 09:02:22.608+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	reasoning-my-way-to-atheism
2	Carl Jung and Spiritualism	2020-07-19 10:00:00+00	t	\N	## Why Carl Jung?\n\nIn the early months of my intense spiritual experiences in spring of 2019, I dug into psychological literature regarding paranormal experiences and the concepts of the collective unconscious. It was clear to me that somewhere, somehow, I had made an intellectual mistake. If I had experienced not one, but multiple, abnormalities where other observers also heard both a ghost and a good friend of mine saw a UFO, then either we were all losing our minds or there was some truth to a spiritual realm - or some realm. There was some truth to paranormal experiences, anyway. Not much else could be said. Certainly there was enough abnormality that it felt at least that an intelligence was paying attention to me.\n\nIn my desperate search, I quickly discovered that mainstream websites and books on the paranormal typically fall into three categories:\n\n1. Awkward, cheesy sites that devolve into insane political conspiracy theories\n2. Religiously motivated sites that quickly push New Age practices\n3. Personal unembellished encounters buried in the interwebs or in long-forgotten books\n\nIt was the third category that quickly interested me most. After all, my own personal story was intense, overwhelming, and difficult to explain. And I was not remotely famous and soon discovered how hard it was to make a story like this go "viral". When I would find a buried YouTube video or a side-note on a famous person's life in their writings, I was beyond intrigued. People who are not driven by a desire for power or money but simply out of fear and curiosity and bewilderment seemed the most easily trusted.\n\nOne of the people who most fascinated me was [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung). He is famous for his feud with Freud over sexuality and his neaerly manic breakdown into a spiritual frenzied writing of the famous [Red Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#The_Red_Book).\n\nJung's paranormal stories are not well known. As I read his book [Memories, Dreams, Reflections](https://www.amazon.com/Memories-Dreams-Reflections-audiobook/dp/B01BW37JXE/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=jung+dreams+memories&qid=1595194895&s=books&sr=1-1), I was taken aback by the depth of his inner spiritual/psychological life. His synchronistic experiences were never talked about in school. Why did the entire psychological establishment skip these stories? Were they just too awkward for a scientific method that claimed to have all the answers?\n\n## Doubt and Close-Mindedness\n\nThe relationship between doubt and close-mindedness fills Jungs writing. He never takes any dogmatic stance on his experiences. He tends to weave the emotional experience of life into the intellectual experience and see patterns where few of us dare to even enter. Here, for example, is an excerpt from Memories, Dreams, Reflections when talking about "Christian dogmatics":\n\n> "That finished it for me. The weighty tome on dogmatics was nothing but fancy drivel; worse still, it was a fraud or a specimen of uncommon stupidity whose sole aim was to obscure the truth. I was disillusioned and even indignant, and once more seized with pity for my father, who had fallen victim to this mumbo-jumbo." - Carl Jung\n\nThis was as accurate a summary of my own feelings when I left Christianity at 23 for a brief agnosticism and then full atheism. I could certainly connect with Jung's skepticism, but the stories he tells of synchronicity left me perplexed with the question of what, exactly, *did* he believe?\n\n> " I wondered at the sureness with which they [friends] could assert that things like ghosts and table-turning were impossible and therefore fraudulent, and on the other hand at the evidently anxious nature of their defensiveness. I, too, was not certain of the absolute reliability of the reports, but why, after all, should there not be ghosts?" - Jung\n\nReading a little further:\n\n> "Dread of what? I could find no explanation for this [materialistic view]. After all, there was nothing preposterous or world-shaking in the idea that there might be events which overstepped the limited categories of space, time, and causality... There were dreams which foresaw the death of certain persons, clocks which stopped at the moment of death, glasses which shattered at the critical moment. All these things had been taken for granted in the world of my childhood." - Jung\n\n## Jung's Paranormal Experiences\n\nLater in the book, Jung tells of an experience I had never heard of in all my classes in biology, psychology, or philosophy and these "missing stories" reveal a lot about how much Freud's materialistic perspective won in the culture war over Jung's:\n\n> "During the summer holidays, however, something happened that was destined to influence me profoundly. One day I was sitting in my room, studying my textbooks. In the adjoining room, the door to which stood ajar, my mother was knitting. That was our dining room, where the round walnut dining table stood. The table had come from the dowry of my paternal grandmother, and was at this time about seventy years old. My mother was sitting by the window, about a yard away from the table. My sister was at school and our maid in the kitchen. **Suddenly there sounded a report like a pistol shot.** I jumped up and rushed into the room from which the noise of the explosion had come. My mother was sitting flabbergasted in her armchair, the knitting fallen from her hands. She stammered out, "W-w-what's happened? It was right beside me!" and stared at the table. Following her eyes, I saw what had happened. **The table top had split from the rim to beyond the center, and not along any joint**; the split ran right through the solid wood. I was thunderstruck. How could such a thing happen? A table of solid walnut that had dried out for seventy years-how could it split on a summer day in the relatively high degree of humidity characteristic of our climate? If it had stood next to a heated stove on a cold, dry winter day, then it might have been conceivable. What in the world could have caused such an explosion? "There certainly are curious accidents," I thought...\n\nA little further:\n\n> Some two weeks later I came home at six o'clock in the evening and found the household - my mother, my fourteen-year-old sister, and the maid-in a great state of agitation. About an hour earlier there had been another deafening report. This time it was not the already damaged table; the noise had come from the direction of the sideboard, a heavy piece of furniture dating from the early nineteenth century. They had already looked all over it, but had found no trace of a split. I immediately began examining the sideboard and the entire surrounding area, but just as fruitlessly. Then I began on the interior of the sideboard. In the cupboard containing the bread basket I found a loaf of bread, and, beside it, the bread knife. **The greater part of the blade had snapped off in several pieces. The handle lay in one corner of the rectangular basket, and in each of the other corners lay a piece of the blade.** The knife had been used shortly before, at four-o'clock tea, and afterward put away. Since then no one had gone to the sideboard.\n\n> The next day I took the shattered knife to one of the best cutlers in the town. He examined the fractures with a magnifying glass, and shook his head. "This knife is perfectly sound," he said. "There is no fault in the steel. Someone must have deliberately broken it piece by piece." " - Jung\n\nThis book is a great read, and is a stream-of-consciousness weaving dreams and stories like these into a tale that in many places defies logic. Once, when arguing with Freud over whether paranormal activity should be included in clinical practice, Freud became angry and Jung rebuked him. A loud thump was heard from the wall. Jung then said that if Freud persisted it would happen again. Freud made a negative remake and the thump once again resounded, almost prophetically. In the annals of history, Freud clearly won this argument but if Jung was right perhaps our rejection of the spiritual realm is exactly what Jung was almost unknowingly warning against.\n\nFor most stories it would be easy to dismiss these synchronistic or paranormal events as flukes, but some of these stories from even well-known intellectuals defy all reason.\n\n## Jordan Peterson's Ghost Stories\n\nJordan Peterson is quite famous, but again his paranormal stories are not nearly as well known:\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GE_mKeDMHm8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI believe that one thing we forget with highly philosophical or spiritual people is that their deepest motivations may be coming from a logic-defying spiritual or overwhelmingly paranormal experience they cannot even begin to describe.\n\nIt is easy to see with a story like this video above why Jordan Peterson connects so much with Carl Jung.\n\n## Jung and UFOs\n\nLater in life, Jung was exploring the UFO phenomena and even wrote a book about it, called [Flying Saucers : A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies](https://www.amazon.com/Flying-Saucers-Modern-Things-Skies/dp/0691018227). I have not read the book yet, so in full disclosure I will not comment on it. However, the mention of myth is interesting, especially given the recent revelation by the Navy, Pentagon, and the Department of Defense that - perhaps - the UFO phenomena has been real this whole time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScientists looks for patterns, and breaks in the patterns are often the greatest sign of a new type of pattern we did not originally think about. Or perhaps a break in the pattern is a sign of intentional tampering with the underlying foundational variables. In any case, curious people at the very least should not throw out data that does not fit their preconceived notions of reality.\n\nIn many ways I think this it what sets men like Carl Jung and Jordan Peterson apart. They are keenly aware of breaks in the patterns of time and space. They know that their methods have limits and are well aware of the arrogance of treading where angels dare to go. And for this, I think, it is an intellectual "sin" to avoid the paranormal.	\N	\N	What drove a famous man like Carl Jung to such intense spiritual reflection later in life?	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-19 21:16:32.904+00	2020-08-09 09:02:33.147+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	carl-jung-and-spiritualism
14	New to the UFO Phenomena?	2020-08-02 12:30:00+00	t	\N	Folkloric and historical records of UFO and other-worldy phenomena have existed since the earliest human records. Ancient civilizations celebrated stories of gods descending from heaven or arriving from ocean crafts. The stories exist the world over, and the Judeo-Christian religions preserve numerous stories in their official and apocryphal texts about similar encounters. Across the world, these beings might teach humans how to do everything from farming to using make-up to attract men. Not all of them were good, and some were quite bad. In the backdrop of these stories we get the ideas of heaven and hell and a cornucopia of historical stories - and myths - regarding "signs in the heavens".\n\nBefore beginning your study, strap yourself in, sit down, get a nice glass of water, and prepare to have your mind's limits challenged. This is not a small topic, and the high strangeness of most of the encounters is so utterly bizarre that most people prefer to avoid it.	2	1	Are you just learning about UFOs after the Navy release and New York Times article in July, 2020?

1	What this is all about...	2020-07-19 10:00:00+00	t	\N	My name is Josh and I live in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2019 After years of a computer science career and as an adamant atheist with a humanist, scientific worldview I had a six-month period of supernatural experiences that shook me back to a theistic view of the world.\n\nDue to the uniqueness of my experiences and my background I returned to a deeper study into theology, Bible, science, and in particular the paranormal. In addition, my supernatural experiences were tightly tied to the dates of the [recent UFO disclosure](https://www.space.com/ufos-videos-declassified-navy-release.html), both the protestant and catholic church, Padre Pio, and the magi in the Bible, and so I feel somewhat compelled to enter the public sphere to talk about what happened.\n\nSo here this blog starts. It is July of 2020 right now, and shortly after my last UFO encounter - within a few weeks actually - Coronavirus had begun ripping its way through China. Now in 2020 it feels like nothing makes sense anymore in the world. The United States economy and political structure are under immense strain, the Navy, Pentagon, and Department of Defense have all acknowledged the existence of radar tracking of classical "tik-tak" UFOs and racist tensions have reached unprecedented levels across the globe. People are flooding the internet with questions asking what in the universe is happening.\n\nFor myself, the experiences I have had have confirmed beyond all doubt that God must exist and that theology, philosophy, biology, and physics are missing or ignoring incredibly important information. There is an element of high strangeness to the universe and our conscious interaction with it and I feel divinely compelled to help guide others from the chaos and pain of life through a return to spiritual connection with the simple kingdom of heaven that Jesus pointed to long ago.\n\nWhat follows is an overview of my story, which is a must read if you want to understand a lot of my thinking on various topics. My thinking is far from doctrinally dogmatic, as I understand the complexity of life and the issues with ancient scriptural texts. But it is my hope that this story will give you some hope and point your spirit and consciousness in a direction toward heaven and classical faith.	1	1	The story that lead me to start this blog.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-19 16:35:26.839+00	2020-08-09 09:02:43.099+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	what-this-is-all-about
21	In Progress	\N	\N	\N	\nIf we do accept the former seven principles, it is important that we have respect in the face of the phenomena.\n\nBecause of my experience I have accepted that the foundational principles of Christianity are rooted in the paranormal phenomena and as a result my own faith is that story being a core part of mankind's story. But I do realize the diversity of experiences goes far beyond what every denomination in Christianity accepts and for this reason I am opposed to a lot of the creedal forms of Christianity and will continue my search and my journey with an open heart to all that is good while remaining skeptical\n# \n\nIt is without a doubt true that each person's conscious experience of the world is unique: we do not all perceive things the same. Some sort of beings are among us, and they are greater than us and reach out and poke their way into our conscious experience of the world at their whim.\n\n# Thinking in Reverse\n\nAncient people tended to accept, without question, that intelligent beings existed. They had strange figures to symbolize them, like the cherubim and seraphim. The creatures had multiple faces, bodies that were of multiple species, and thrones. The people developed complex myths and entire religious narratives around these sightings, whether under the influence of drugs or alcohol - it does not matter. I, for one, believe some of the experiences must have been real. What they were experiencing is the real question.\n\nIf we reverse the thought process, however, and propose that - indeed - some form of intelligence is manipulating these things, we start to see something interesting.\n\nLet us propose that beings exist, whether alien or supernatural, which have an interest in mankind. They may have interest in other things as well, but mankind is one of their things of interest. Perhaps their reasons are so far above ours that we cannot really understand what would even drive them to be interested. They possess a deep understanding of consciousness, of life and death, and are interacting with mankind on that set of knowledge.\n\nThey clearly can heal people, as many religious and UFO stories have made clear. But they seem to do so in the strangest of ways and times. The angel used to go down and stir the waters - once a year - and the first person to dip into them for a bath would be healed. This story sounds fantastical, and for some reason Jesus did not bat an eye about it. Clearly the readers of the day saw no problem with this little exercise. These beings have no desire - or ability - to just heal everyone. And somehow that is just the way things are. There is clearly a *story* behind their behavior that is unfathomable.\n\nWhen they do communicate with mankind, they seem rather keen on exhibiting patterns that are meaningful to the individual, but not to all of mankind at once. For example, one paranormal vision to the right person at the right time can mean the world, but when explaining the vision to someone else, the same power will not be felt.\n\nWhen supernatural experiences happen in front of multiple individuals, the individuals themselves report different phenomena. In Fatima, many saw the sun as different colors or shapes. Some saw nothing. In my own ghost experience, Rick heard a rushing wind sound, and I heard distinct female words. In the story of God's voice from heaven confirming Jesus, some said it was just thunder. "Each person heard them in his own language" as the author of Acts reports. This is a rather consistent theme.\n\n> The type of communication exhibited during paranormal events, from religious to UFO sightings, appears to be highly correlated to the conscious state of the receiver. This mimics what Jesus taught, that somehow a thing called "faith", and the amount one has, is correlated with ones ability to experience blessing.\n\nIt appears to me that the "language of the gods" - the type of communication - is first and foremost on a layer of human conscious experience that bypasses the parts of our brain that normally process language. The primary means of communication is symbolic, where the symbols used are the ones that most effectively alter the conscious experience of the observer for both immediate and long-term change. This goes for both "good" and "bad" paranormal encounters. It is clear that with this style of communication being present, the possibility of deep deception is high.\n\n	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	2020-08-06 08:25:28.703+00	2020-08-06 08:25:28.717+00	\N	1	1	\N	\N	\N
15	Evidence for the Skeptics	2020-08-02 13:30:00+00	t	\N	\n# Official Documents for the Skeptic\n\nTraditionally, the skeptical community has spent considerable time debunking one story after another. In some cases, their explanations for a video might be long-winded and somewhat fantastical, but for a skeptic a natural explanation is always to be preferred over a "supernatural" one. But this all changed in 2019 with two important events:\n\n* [Wilson Memo Leak of April 19, 2019](https://joshunplugged.com/blogPosts/13)\n* [Navy Disclosure of GIMBAL, GOFAST, and FLIR videos on September 18, 2019](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/09/18/ufo-videos-are-footage-real-unidentified-objects-us-navy-acknowledges.html)\n\nThe first event was mostly passed around within the UFO community and, despite its high visibility, it did not really get a lot of press time. The second event, however, was ground-breaking. It was the first time that a government body in the United States acknowledged that UFO/UAP phenomena had been recorded by numerous observers and multiple radar systems simultaneously. There had been stories since the early days of flight of observations of strange phenomena in the skies, but the government had always given cover stories or dismissed it as the wandering psyches of the laymen.\n\nWith the Navy acknowledgement, the Pentagon and Department of Defense followed up by releasing their own official statements confirming the Navy's statements.\n\n[The official Department of Defense statement and a link to download the government videos can be found here.](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2165713/statement-by-the-department-of-defense-on-the-release-of-historical-navy-videos/)\n\n## GIMBAL Video Unedited\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKHg-vnTFsM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## GOFAST Video Unedited\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8xFZVJpY_M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## FLIR Video Unedited\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KcOzXVO8O8w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n# Press Releases of 2020\n\nTraditionally, the press has been reluctant - or coyish - about their reporting of UFOs. They tended to put the reporting as a "cute" segment at the end of their news cycle. But in July of 2020, shortly after I began this blog, the New York Times finally released their long-awaited "bombshell" article:\n\n* [No Longer in Shadows, Pentagon’s U.F.O. Unit Will Make Some Findings Public](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/pentagon-ufo-harry-reid-navy.html)\n* [Editorial Followup: Do We Believe in U.F.O.s? That’s the Wrong Question](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/insider/UFO-reporting.html)\n\nHarry Reid, mentioned in the article, had traditionally been for the release of this information, as evidence by the following Tweet:\n\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m glad the Pentagon is finally releasing this footage, but it only scratches the surface of research and materials available.

8	UFOs, Demons, Angels, and Padre Pio	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	## Dark Presence Returns\n\nInstantly after that short prayer, my room, for the first time in ten years, filled with a darker and more evil presence than I had ever experienced even in my teens. It was so strong and powerful it felt like a bubble enveloped my apartment and like all noise outside had been stopped. My heartbeat rose and goosebumps stood up on my entire body. This thing was enraged at me with the deepest level of hate I have ever felt in my life. I was frozen in place. I had completely forgotten about this presence for over ten years, and now, in one moment, it was back. I pulled the covers near my head and squinted my eyes I was honestly so afraid it would show its face or kill me.\n\nI begged and begged and begged God to take this thing away. Just to protect me. At that moment I felt a small light inside me get lit, like I was feeling or seeing with a third eye. A little white light, like a small candle of flame. From it I felt a voice say “I will protect you.”\n\n## Sanity Checking\n\nI had not touched a Bible seriously in ages, other than to debunk some stupid Christians.\n\n> What I was experiencing did not really fit any particular theological scheme or story I had heard before. Either I was absolutely crazy and this was all in my head, or all this stuff that many religions have been talking about has some truth to it. For the next couple of months, I could not go back to my apartment without feeling the heavy oppressive weight of that dark presence. When awake or sleeping.\n\nI began researching paranormal and spiritual things again, trying to piece together all I was experiencing. Ghosts and haunted houses? Evil presences? In addition, I went back to my therapist and told him about all of this. The first time I told my therapist about the ghost experience, his camera which he uses to make clips for training actually turned off while I was telling the story. Coincidence? Probably. But at this point things were too weird to make a judgment call. Stuff like this began happening nearly daily.\n\nTo be sure, my life was radically shifting toward the supernatural and the only piece of verifiable external evidence was a single little female voice in an apartment from a year before. **If that voice could not be confirmed, I was obviously losing my mind.** So to verify my memory, I did the only sane thing I could do: I contacted Rick. What I wanted to do was have him recount back to me what happened in that AirBnB the day I was there. And I wanted to make sure that I did not “prompt” him with any memories, so I would not mention details. To this day I still have the initial messages on LinkedIn. We played phone tag for two or three weeks.\n\n## The First UFOs Sighting (April 22, 2019)\n\nWhile I waited for Rick to get back to me my third supernatural event occurred. After sharing the ghost story the first time in Ibiza, I had begun to test it out on others. My motivations for sharing it were mixed. On the one hand, it was a super fun story that tended to stump people. On the other hand, I was hoping someone would be able to come up with a natural explanation for what happened that fit all the facts I knew. Of the half a dozen people I told, nobody had come up with an even reasonable conclusion other than I had been pranked. Many people, realizing I was opening up, responded by telling a crazy story of their own. *I learned about ghosts slamming doors and whispering in ears, of premonitions of in-family deaths and tragedies, and more. And these stories were coming from secular Swedes.* Were Swedes, in an attempt to maintain their image as happy atheists, hiding their own spiritual stories?\n\nI grew up with a friend who I will call Jared on the same street back in Wichita and - coincidentally - we both moved to Sweden within about two weeks of each other without even planning it. He was mostly agnostic, probably leaning atheist, when we arrived in Sweden. We would occasionally meet for beers or ultimate frisbee.\n\nApril 22, 2019 (from a photo I took that day) in the beautiful spring weather of Stockholm, we decided to go to a park called Rålambshovs. During our visit, Jared asked what was going on and somehow that turned into a discussion about my ghost experience since I was in the habit of bringing it up now. Like everyone else, he was skeptical but confused. He suggested it was probably a prank, and I said that maybe it was but I was going to talk to Rick soon to get that cleared up.\n\nWhile we sat there on the grass in the absolutely beautiful summer day in an almost cloudless sky, I looked up and saw a tiny, disc-shaped object high up in the brilliant blue atmosphere moving faster than the many airliners that buzzed around. It had no contrail as all the other planes did.\n\n**“What is that?” I said as I pointed upwards.**\n\nJared looked up, saw it, and said he did not know.\n\n**“Look, there are two of them!”**\n\nThere were two disc-shaped tiny objects super high in the atmosphere moving in formation. As we watched we joked that this was why people always had blurry videos of them. There was absolutely no way we could zoom our phone cameras in enough to see them, as we could barely keep our eyes focused on them. Jared made a comment he was having a hard time disctinguishing them from eye floaters, and I agreed. They were super tiny and super far away. They flew across the sky incredibly rapidly for about 10 seconds and then out of view. Jared made some comments about them being a government black-ops project. We shared a few text messages later about them which I still have to this day.\n\n> About 5 minutes after the two UFOs disappeared, I took the following photo of an airplane with a rare shadow underneath it called a contrail shadow. I want to be clear, this part is a [natural phenomena](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/contr2.htm) but is insanely rare to catch from such an exact position on the ground. I put this photo here, taken on April 22, 2019 as evidence of the type of sky conditions when we saw the two UFOs. I got a distinct impression when seeing this that heaven was telling me that my life would be like this airplane, destined through a tunnel already set in front of me.\n\n![Airplane through Shadow](https://joshoncode.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/8ceac869183b40a290395494586dbdd8.JPG)\n**Note: this is NOT the UFO, but a picture I took a few minutes after of a shadow contrail.**\n\n## Paranormal Research Begins\n\nMy experiences at home with a demonic presence were terrifying still and I began to watch a lot of YouTube videos of people experiencing the paranormal. At this point I was reversing that portion of the process that drove me to atheism. **However, when I was 23 and beginning to doubt, I studied these topics to find solid evidence for the paranormal and could not find it. But this time I began my study knowing I had some evidence but searching to find an explanation!** Wanting to begin with the great intellectual masters rather than some religious nuts, I read a lot by Carl Jung, who as a founder of psychotherapy, feuded with Freud about whether paranormal events should be included into their treatments of patients.\n\nCarl Jung experienced profound premonitions and unexplainable poltergeist phenomena which rarely made it into school literature. [He wrote about a story of a walnut table that exploded next to his mother, of a knife in a cupboard that shattered into pieces on its own](https://joshunplugged.com/blogPosts/2), and of his children having the bedsheets ripped off their beds when he was going through the spiritual transformation that lead to his writing of the famous Red Book. He tells stories of patients in insane asylums that knew things they could not have possibly had access to, and of how it was well known at the time that clocks would stop when a person connected with them died. He tells how native people would often explain that when white men infiltrated a new region the native dreams and visions would stop. And he also explained how a loud thumping noise scared Freud - twice - when they were debating the supernatural in psychology. I highly recommend reading about these things on your own in Jung’s works - particularly in the book Memories, Dreams, Reflections. How had I missed stories like these during my earlier search and even if I did see them, how had I completely neglected them?\n\nOne night I found a video of a woman who hosted a YouTube channel about makeup and fashion. She had one video where she tells about a haunted house her family moved into when she was a little girl. There was a dark presence that would come into the hallway at night outside her door and stand in front of her parents room. As if confirming her suspicions, every time this happened, their dog would growl at it. One night the apparition laid down next to her in bed and when she moved out of terror as it slid behind her neck, the duvet was ripped from her bed and flung across the room and landed on the television. She screamed. Her dad came into the room as she trembled in fear on her bed. Her family had an emergency meeting the next day where they all admitted strange things were happening but nobody had spoken up because everyone was in denial. The parents requested a priest come into the house, perform some rites, and the strangeness died down after that. She said since that day no more experiences like that ever happened. And here she was, all these years later, doing a YouTube channel on fashion and makeup. She only had the one video about the paranormal and seemed genuinely terrified, just like I was.\n\nA common pattern I discovered about people who experience the paranormal, whether dark or light, is the fear. People who experience these things tell them as if the thing that happened could easily happen again. Locality plays a part in most paranormal stories. People experience the paranormal only in certain locations or with certain objects. For example, consider the strange happenings of Skinwalker Ranch or of cattle mutilations. One final important piece of information seems to be that much paranormal activity seems to be centered on an individual but affects everyone in their vicinity. I will leave it to the reader to do their own research. Needless to say the confusion, the lies, the grifters, and the fakery surrounding these events often tends to stifle any belief in them. It is no wonder so many people just keep quiet about their own experiences.\n\nNeedless to say, these stories from other people made me more uneasy. Still skeptical, I acknowledged their inconsistency as a solid piece of evidence that they were all rubbish and based in imagination. Maybe aliens existed, but aliens and ghosts and Jesus at the same time? This was too much. But now I had two rubbish experiences of my own! And the more I acknowledged these experiences the more something seemed to get angry. **Having dual confirmation of a similar poltergeist phenomena from Jung nearly 100 years before and a young girl in the 1990s of sheets being ripped off of beds, I became very afraid it was going to happen to me with the dark presence that would repeatedly appear.**\n\nThe dark presence was mostly around when I was going to sleep but I often could feel it about 10 meters from my apartment door as I walked home. To this point, I had not told anybody about the dark presence because I wanted to make sure people would not think I was insane until I had some better evidence.\n\n## A Ghostly Confirmation\n\nThe following weekend, I finally had a chance to talk to Rick. After no small struggle trying to find a working audio connection, we began talking. I took notes, best I could, because I did not want to forget anything.\n\n[My original notes for my conversation with Rick can be found here.](https://joshunplugged.com/blogPosts/7)\n\n> There were only three possible outcomes to this conversation. First, if Rick did not recall events at the AirBnB exactly as I did, then my memory was faulty and I definitely was hearing voices and needed to take medication. Second, if Rick admitted he was playing a prank by imitating a woman’s voice somehow, then everything I was experiencing was based on a joke and hallucinations. But, third, if Rick just naturally shared what was in my memory but from his perspective, then my life was about to change forever.\n\nThis latter option was the one I wanted the least. Being mentally ill would be the easiest pill to swallow.\n\nRick started the conversation by asking why I wanted to chat. I meekly told him that I had been thinking about the day in the AirBnB where we both had the weird experience and wanted him to recount what he remembered from his perspective.\n\nHe recalled that I came down the stairs and went into the bathroom to take a shower while he was working. Then he heard the “whooshing” sound in front of the door and I responded to it. Then I turned off the shower, and I spoke to it again. When I came out, Rick remembered me speaking first: “who wanted into the bathroom” or something like that. That last part was a minor detail that was different than my story and surprisingly this actually made his portion of the story more believable.\n\nAsking him lots of questions, I pieced together our two perspectives and they were incredibly congruent after an entire year. I could not help but think about how hard it must have been for early Christians to piece together their stories too.\n\nAfter confirming every major detail without me prompting him, Rick became solemn. He told me he had thought of that day many times since. He had even spoken to the owner - who was a family friend of his - and asked more about it. She told him of numerous other strange stories in the house that he did not know about until after our experience with the woman’s voice. Apparently the owner’s son had some experience in one of the rooms of the house as a child that was so shocking that, as an adult, he refused to go into that room. The owner’s daughter seemed to be the center point of most of the experiences. A woman who was a medium refused to even go into the house because it overwhelmed her so much.\n\n> At this point I was just hunched in my bed, humbled into silence. This was not the answer I wanted.\n\nRick again repeated that he was a Christian and he **asked me if I knew what a “word of knowledge” was**. *He said that he thought whatever the voice told me in that bathroom was a “special message to you and I was the witness”.* Then he asked me what the voice said because he had forgotten what I told him. When I said it only said “Excuse me, sir?” he had no explanation. He told me that only I would know what the message meant. **I did not want to admit it, but I now knew what the voice meant. This was the spiritual realm gently and politely, twice, asking me to acknowledge its existence.** The story of Samuel in the Bible flashed before my mind more than once. In the Biblical story Samuel thinks the voice he hears twice is actually Eli, but it turns out to be an angel (angel in Greek simply means "messenger" and was a term used of messengers or emissaries for royalty).\n \nRick and I spoke for an hour and forty minutes. He told me a story about his strange experiences sharing God with the late owner of Gore-Tek’s wife before she died. At one point, she pulled Rick aside and matter-of-factly told him that “I think I am a Christian now”. She died shortly after. Rick was an evangelist, and here he was evangelizing an atheist he had met only once before outside a bathroom in an AirBnB in London.\n\nRick tells me that he had often experienced a dark presence hovering over him and that while he is not the best Christian, his faith “is as strong as Billy Graham’s”. I told him that I have experienced something similar to a dark presence and thought maybe it was sleep paralysis but I had confirmed in my case it was not. **Without prompting, Rick says “Josh, you do not need to be afraid, it is not like it is going to rip the sheets off your bed or something.”**\n\nThis was real. All of this was real. How did Rick know about my fear about the sheets being ripped off my bed? I had not told him! This pattern of synchronous communication and alignment of events across time became the norm.\n\nAfter we finished the call, the hateful presence rose in front of me for the last time. For the hundredth time I pulled the covers toward my head, terrified to completely open my eyes, squinting at the darkness for fear of seeing a face. But then I felt a new presence enter the room. It was white and pure, it rose up in front of the darkness, and was equally terrifying. It split into two bright white forms, about three meters tall, and the two of them moved to either end of my apartment. It is hard to explain this unless you have experienced it, it is as if you are seeing a colorful presence but not with your physical eyes - like an aura. It was ghostly and brilliant and the air was thick and charged. Goosebumps covered my body, my heartbeat was raised, and I was so terrified these creatures would show themselves. Deep in my soul, a still small voice told me “Josh, you need this protection”. The darkness went away but I felt a heavy commotion in my spirit.\n\nWhen most people share stories of experiencing the presence of angels, I am skeptical for a different reason now. The terror I felt in the presence of angels was, lighter and more cheerful, but it was still terror. I felt unholy, evil, selfish, and dirty. They were awesome. I felt as if my heart was laid bare and I was completely unworthy. Now I know why the saints used to bow to the angels until the angels would raise them to their feet and tell them to worship God instead. “Do not let me see your face or I will die” I begged, and I felt them gently agree. Unlike the dark presence they seemed to want me to be comfortable. Later I would read a Catholic priest explain that this is well known in the Catholic church that angels like us to be comfortable and not to scare us with their presence if possible.\n\n## Padre Pio and My Prophetic Key Dream\n\n![Padre Pio](https://joshoncode.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/73dac13e91a842ea9ef786cdc30fed43.jpg)\n\nI still thought at this point that maybe all that was happening was in my head, but I had no idea what to do about it other than watch and pray. I knew I needed to figure out what the message they had for me was. Why did I need protection? What was this dark presence going to do? It felt as if I was being guided down a tunnel; as if I was being driven forward into a direction that I could not resist - just like that airplane.\n\n> As an act of faith, I really only had one tangible thing to do next. Rick suggested I read a book about Padre Pio, the Catholic Saint from Italy during World War 2 who was one of the most extraordinary spiritual characters of the 20th century.\n\n“Great”, I thought as I internally rolled my spiritual eyes. “None of this is helping me yet.”\n\nSomehow I was bouncing from an Episcopalian and a female ghost voice in an apartment, to seeing two UFOs with my childhood friend, to experiencing angels in my apartment, and now I am supposed to read about a Catholic Saint who had supposedly had the stigmata in the 1940s? How on God’s green earth was I ever supposed to make sense of this mess? \n\n> During this time I was praying fervently, from the bottom of my heart, that even if I was the only person who could possibly understand what was going on in the universe that God and these angels or whatever they were would reveal it to me. I would rather die than not find the truth. What the heck was going on?\n\n**I read the story about Padre Pio with my skeptic hat on (the book is [Padre Pio: the Stigmatist](https://www.tanbooks.com/padre-pio-the-stigmatist.html)), but out of faith that the angels would not have lead me to Rick if they did not want me to listen.** As I read, I imagined all the fraud and lies that must have backed his ministry and the stigmata. I read about confirmed report after confirmed report of Pio’s healings and prophecies. Padre Pio supposedly began his early ministry with incredible dark spirits attacking him. He also told stories of how the angels would sometimes protect him and he spoke about his angels as real beings that were nearby. The realization that the dark entity in my life hated me so much compelled me to do anything I possibly could to avoid doing what it wanted, just like Pio did.\n\nNear the end of the book after all the healing stories there is a short selection of Padre Pio’s writings. These were actually more interesting to me than the miracles. The reason is that Padre Pio’s heart seemed pure and honest. Would a man who loved Jesus and the angels this much make it all up? Then I read this:\n\n> “The Devil is like a mad dog tied by a chain. Beyond the length of the chain he cannot catch hold of anyone. And you, therefore, keep your distance. If you get too close you will be caught. Remember, the Devil has only one door with which to enter into our soul: our will. There are no secret or hidden doors. No sin is a true sin if we have not willfully consented.” ~ Padre Pio\n\n[Remember my Prophetic Key Dream from the dark period of my life, nearly 15 years prior?](https://joshunplugged.com/blogPosts/3)\n\nI dropped the book with my jaw open. In one pure moment, God linked this simple paragraph to my dream from the darkest point of my teens.\n\n	1	6	Thinks ramp up beyond reason with a UFO sighting, and an angelic presence in my apartment.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 19:44:04.894+00	2020-08-09 09:00:39.674+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	ufos-demons-angels-padre-pio
5	Ghost in London	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	Six months after moving to Sweden an event occurred that was so extraordinary it would change my life forever.\n\nOne day around the end of October near Halloween in 2017 I got a chance to visit a couple friends in London that I met at a tech conference. This was almost exactly two years ago from the date I write this.\n\nI scheduled the flight to London, got confirmation from the friend, and the day before I was to fly the friend informed me he had forgotten I was coming and I would need to find somewhere else to stay. My friend Mari suggested I still go and make the best of things. So I packed up my backpack and left without a place to stay.\n\nUpon arrival in London, I contacted a different friend Lisa and she agreed to meet for beers. She said the friend who was supposed to host me was an ass and that I could stay with her for at least the first night but she was pretty busy. Not wanting to impose for too many nights, I booked an AirBnB for the second night.\n\nAs scheduled, that second night I went to the AirBnB. The building was difficult to find, built in the 1600s and nestled behind its neighbors with a number panel not easily seen from the street. It was three stories tall and owned by a woman who greeted me and informed me that her children had moved out and now she rented the rooms to guests to make money. Because she had several guests, she explained the sole bathroom would be busy so I needed to be mindful of time. She also introduced me to one of her tenants named Rick who was working in the living room next to the bathroom and asked politely for me not to bother him. Rick was busy working on editing an international film for a United Nations project about women in STEM in Africa. I agreed to be quiet and he went back to his video editing.\n\nThe following morning, I got up and went downstairs to take a shower. The owner handed me some towels. **While in the shower with the water running, I heard her voice outside the door saying “excuse me, sir?”** Figuring she must have forgotten something, I responded quickly asking what she needed. No response. She must have made a mistake and left.\n\nThe next day I had a halloween party with my friend Lisa. After the party Lisa agreed that I could stay at her place and I was secretly hoping I could save money and not have to book anymore AirBnB stays for the entire weekend. On Sunday, however, she informs me that she had a ton of work to do since she was starting her new recruiting business on Monday morning So Lisa kindly asked me to go back to the AirBnB so she could focus. Annoyed, I checked if the same AirBnB was available and booked it last minute and then immediately headed over.\n\nThe next day I had an important interview with my dream company, Spotify, so I wanted to be prepared early. **While in the shower, I heard her voice again saying “Excuse me, sir?”** This is bordering on annoyance. Why does this woman only seem to bother me when I am in the shower. So again I responded with “Hello, who is it, what do you need?” No response. So I turned off the shower water, thinking that perhaps the running water was too loud. “Hello?” No response. What was wrong with this woman.\n\nAs I left the bathroom, Rick looked up from his laptop in the living room and asked:\n\n“Josh, who were you talking to in there?”\n\n“Oh the owner walked by and must have wanted in for something.”\n\n**“Josh, we are the only two people in the apartment right now.”**\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n**“There was nobody there, I was here the entire time you were in the shower. The owner has not been here for quite some time.”**\n\nIt was true, he was sitting at his computer, easily within eyesight of the bathroom door, which was why he looked up to talk to me when I exited. Unfazed, I said that maybe I had actually heard something else rather than a person’s voice. Then he informed me that he heard something too, but it wasn’t a voice. It was a sound like a puff of wind. I asked where he heard it, and he said it was about head-height in front of the bathroom door - on the outside. He said he just thought it was weird until I responded to it. Then he heard me turn the shower water off and I responded again and then knew that it was more than just a puff of wind.\n\nThen he asked me the strangest question:\n\n“Josh, are you religious by any chance?”\n\n“No, but I used to be. Now I am an atheist.”\n\n“Ah, that must be what it is...”\n\nThis suggestion made me upset. He explained that he was “Episcopalian, it is like Catholic-lite.” I had left the United States to get away from religious nuts, and here at some random AirBnB I am face-to-face with one. This was my area of expertise! I had trained my whole life for this moment. I could prove to him he had gone too far. All I needed to do was to find the source of the “voice”, which I had obviously misinterpreted, and make the same sound again.\n\nFor the next forty-five minutes I did everything I possibly could to try and recreate the sound, or anything even remotely like it. I checked the walls, which were solid stones from the late middle-ages. We checked the sound of all doors opening and closing. I checked for any speakers, pipes, wiring, or anything else. The house was very old and most electrical and piping was exposed, but none of it was near the source of the voice. We both identified the source of the voice/sound to be the same location, but we both heard different things. He heard a “whooshing” sound, like a puff of air, but I heard a female voice. Not giving up easily, I turned on the shower at the exact temperature I had used it (the knob was still set to where I had it), closed the bathroom door, and waited for 20 minutes. My theory was that a pressure differential had built up and there was a release of steam. No matter what I tried, there was no way to explain what happened and we never heard anything.\n\nRick mentioned that he was friends with the owners of the house and came there often to get away and focus on his work since he regularly travels all over the world and is quite busy. He had showered in that room dozens of times and had never heard anything like what just happened.\n\nSomehow I heard the same female voice twice, on two separate days booked independently of each other, in the same house, and the second time there was an external witness to the event who just happened to be an Episcopalian Christian. The only reasonable explanation was that someone played a prank on me both days, and the only person who seemed capable of it was Rick. But here he was legitimately concerned that something spiritual happened. I was stumped.\n\nIt is worth noting at this point that what happened did not fit any worldview I could possibly imagine. It was so highly strange even for someone raised in the protestant church. In most Christian denominations, a “haunting” is considered a demonic appearance. But in this case, Rick was an Episcopalian who did not even mention demons, he just seemed to think something strange was happening. I could not think of a single theological reason why a female ghost in a house in London was politely and gently saying “Excuse me, sir?” while I showered. The experience contradicted every piece of information I had about the human psyche, human evolution, sound waves (I had studied audio engineering for a previous job in artificial intelligence and even have open-source projects available online in FFT, DFT, and MFCC), and was the only time in my life that I had heard a voice that did not exist. And someone else also heard it. And nobody was there. My brain broke.\n\nWhile we chatted in the living room, the landlord came back through the front door with groceries in her hands. She was surprised that we were deep in conversation and asked how we were doing. We explained what happened and her response was:\n\n> “Oh, the house is haunted, that stuff happens all the time. Many guests have seen a woman who does not live here, but nobody has ever said they heard a voice.”\n\nBelow is a layout of the house, as drawn by me, to try and figure out where the voice could have come from:\n\n![Layout of Apartment](https://joshoncode.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/75f56fd2f6674728899037106f6acfbf.JPG)\n	1	4	The ghost story that stunned me, with a witness who confirmed everything...	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 19:18:56.225+00	2020-08-09 09:01:35.232+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	ghost-in-london
6	From Best to Worst to "Born Again" Experience	2020-07-20 10:00:00+00	t	\N	## At the Top of Life\n\nFor the next year I blocked the ghost event out of my mind as I began my new job at Spotify. I was not about to let one strange, potentially supernatural experience be the foundation for changing my atheist views. And even if I was going to let it change my views, what in the world would I change them to? “Excuse me, sir?” from a strange female ghost in an AirBnB in London gave me no tangible information other than hinting maybe there was more to life than our classical materialistic perspective.\n\nMy job at Spotify was incredible, and I felt like I was on the top of the world for about eight or nine months. This was the engineers dream that I had been working toward my entire atheist life! I was dating eastern european women, living in the “hip” country on the planet with the best rating for human rights, and working at a company that had just gone IPO. This was the highest point for me.\n\nBut after around six months things started to crumble. One manager in particular began to be super hostile toward me. My personal life was a mixture of ups and downs, and a woman I was dating - who I had been warned was probably trouble - attacked me after an argument where I asked her to leave my apartment, broke my hand, and then insinuated that if I called the police she was just going to lie about what happened. This was right during the #metoo movement as well so I suspected nobody would believe my story. It felt like everything was turning against me and this liberal atheist utopia was not nearly as innocent as I thought.\n\nAround this time I had a short vacation to Ibiza. My friends and I met up with some girls and one of them was a proud scientific atheist. She announced that she could explain anything paranormal. Suddenly for the first time in nearly nine months, I remembered my ghost experience in London. Maybe this girl could explain it? After telling the story, she got super quiet. She tried a few simple explanations and then gave up. It began to dawn on me that maybe I did have a solid paranormal or spiritual experience, after all? As I thought about it more, I realized my one experience checked off all the boxes I could think about for confirming a supernatural event. What if the experience was the answer to my prayer for some form of "evidence" that was not only in my head? And if it was an answer to my prayer, what in the world could it possibly mean? **A disembodied female voice announcing greetings outside a shower door is no basis for a religion.**\n\n## Spiritual Panic\n\nIn February of 2019, an international paperwork mixup at Spotify with the stock management company caused a glitch which nearly lead to all of my options at the company being sold and accidentally sent to the IRS as taxes. In a full-blown panic while I was filling out the paperwork at the last minute in an attempt to hit a one hour deadline before all my money went “poof” to the United States government I got a text from a girl I really liked saying she enjoyed our date but was pretty busy and would not be able to meet anytime soon. Dropping my paperwork, I replied angrily. This was the worst timing. First my boss turns against me, then a coworker starts bullying me, then a girl breaks my hand and now not only am I in the middle of potentially losing all my Spotify stocks, but a girl rejects me on the same day?\n\nThat night I lost it. I was at my dream job, in my dream country, living my atheist life and events were just continuing to be against me. It felt like I was fighting against something. Seething, I went to bed that night and tried to sleep. Because I was waiting for a reply on the paperwork I sent, which was in New York timezone, I was not going to know if it made it in time to stop the draining of my account until 4am.\n\n> In my rage and insomnia, I started thinking.\n\nI thought about my family. My one Christian brother had a great wife and several beautiful children and he seemed rather content and happy. Heck, even their cockatoo seemed happier than me. My other brother, despite being even more of a rebel in many ways than me, got married as well and seemed to be putting his life together. My family may be desperately wrong about their religion, but they seemed to be happier than me. How was it that I was pursuing this life of radical devotion to the truth and my life sucked so much? How was it that these intellectually hypocritical Christians had it better than me?\n\nBut then I got to thinking about my life. I mean, I was a hypocrite too. After all, I was angry that this girl rejected me, but I had literally just rejected a girl a week before so I could date this new girl. I really had no right to be mad. In fact, I had no right to be mad at anybody. Sure, some of my friends were making more money than me back in the United States, but it was my choice to go to Sweden. It was my choice to not get married to one of the sweet women that liked me when I was younger so that I could play the field. It was my choice to not have kids and settle down back at home like my brother. It was my decisions that lead to me being alone and in a country with lower salaries and higher taxes. It was my decisions that lead me to being a rational atheist and ignoring my hearts pleas for meaning.\n\nThen I again remembered the voice from the AirBnB and broke down. Maybe there was something to the supernatural. Certainly at least one spirit seemed willing to reach out, so maybe there was more? I could sure use it right now. I decided to pray a simple prayer, alone in my bedroom:\n\n> “God, or whatever you are, I am so sorry. I am so sorry for being so hypocritical. I have been living my life completely for myself, completely selfishly. If there is any chance you are there and listening, please help me. I don’t want to live my life for myself anymore.”\n	1	5	From the height of my life to a collapse, I finally decided to reach out and see if perhaps heaven could help.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-20 19:28:46.001+00	2020-08-09 09:02:12.018+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	born-again-experience
20	The Seven Rules of Supernatural Interpretation	2020-08-05 22:00:00+00	t	\N	# Background\n\nRecently I have been reading the book [Beyond UFOs: The Science of Consciousness and Contact with New Human Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40904819-beyond-ufos). It explores a large scale (N=3256) survey on people who have had some form of contact with UFO phenomena. The authors eliminate all stories that include sleep or sleep paralysis. While the annoying constant pedaling of their foundation has made reading the book frustrating, their results reflect similar to the types of stories in [Passport to Magonia](https://www.bookdepository.com/Passport-Magonia-Jacques-Vallee/9780987422477) and for this reason it has interested me extensively.\n\n# UFOs Exhibit Inconsistent Patterns\n\nThere are a few things that modern UFO/UAP phenomena seem to have in common: the forms of abduction "story" or report, the saucer shape, the rapid life-like movements, etc. But even within these same themes, there is wide divergence in the sensory data received.\n\nIn Beyond UFOs, some people are abducted by spirit figures but others by physical humans. Some see grey aliens that are short, others see tall. Some see bright orbs hovering, others see physical objects. In opposition to the general narrative, most people do not want their experiences to stop - not even abductions - and the majority of people (> 70%) considered their experience to be good and report positive conscious transformations as a result.\n\nInterestingly, some experiencers are absolutely positive a physical object (e.g. flying saucer landed on ground) was present, with witnesses who confirm their story, whereas others claim they were transported to some form of a "Matrix-like" reality and were not even sure if they were in their own body. This echoes quite closely what the apostle Paul says in his letter: "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows." ([2 Cor. 12:2-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12%3A2-4&version=NIV)) Paul clearly cannot determine if it was physical or not.\n\nSimilarly, in Passport to Magonia, people in the 1800s and back to the medieval ages saw both blimp-like crafts and fairy creatures. They had gnomes and trickster dwarves spiriting them away to strange lands. In one story, they claim to have caught some of these people who were flying around in their crafts - who were indistinguishable from humans - and the townpeople were fighting over what to do with them. It was so commonly known for these "beings" to steal children from women (known as [changlings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling#:~:text=A%20changeling%2C%20also%20historically%20referred,child%20stolen%20by%20the%20fairies.)), that even some Christian leaders like Martin Luther wrote about them. If we go back to Genesis 6 and the Book of Enoch, we find the stories of the gods coming down and stealing women and having children with them. We could go all Michael Shermer and reject all of these stories outright, but many of these stories involve dozens of witnesses and followup research.\n\nIn most cases, people experience the UFO and UAP phenomena with a heightened conscious awareness, seeing orbs (many captured on film or video) and visions, seeing auras, strange dreams, and - in Jungian language - an increase of synchronous experiences. For this reason, some like Jung have proposed the theory that the modern UFO phenomena is a new myth or legend or even a new type of religion.\n\nThe only thing that seems consistent throughout history about the phenomena is that the appearances often include some form of flying things (not affected by gravity) and confuse and baffle the observer - and drive them to change their life in some way. But the specific details are so varied that attempting to approach them scientifically is virtually impossible.\n\n# Obfuscation\n\n**Obfuscation is the intentional scrambling of important information so that the source cannot be easily deduced or decoded while not destroying the original information.** It is often used in computers to keep third parties from figuring out what is going on. It feels to me that there is intentional obfuscation in all paranormal experience.\n\n> I would propose that the uniqueness of each experience, when even multiple people experience that same phenomena at the same time, and the lack of direct logical and methodical communication of information is completely intentional and reveals that these beings are consistently obfuscating their interaction with us.\n\nAs Paul says, in his followup to the previous quote,\n\n> "[he] was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell."\n\nThis theme is found still today, in many Christians who experience visions or OOB (out-of-body) experiences. One is forced to ask the question, what in the world could be the point of telling an individual things not permitted to tell? Why tell them in the first place?\n\n# My Seven Rules of Supernatural Encounters\n\nIf I were to be so bold, it feels that there are several consistent things we can conclude from the mass of thousands and thousands of cases:\n\n1. The phenomena is real\n2. The phenomena exhibits characteristics of physical and beyond physical properties\n3. The phenomena always presents as an individually-tailored transfer of illogical information to individuals\n4. The phenomena **never** presents without *some form of obfuscation*\n5. Attempts to interpret an experience are *always* wrong in some way, even when the information seems clear (e.g. end times predictions, prophecies, etc.)\n6. Because of the former five rules, the phenomena is nearly impossible to distinguish from hoaxes\n7. Because of the former six rules, belief in the phenomena requires a personal encounter or "faith"\n\nI would argue it was for these reasons that there was heavy overlap in the ancient times between priests, sorcerers, and wise men and women. The concept of a "seer", or one who sees things others do not, was revered by many. Yet you did not go to a seer for advice on which soil is best for your crop. The distinction between priests and philosophers goes back to the B.C. era. Philosophers thought long and hard and logically about things, while seers sought the gods and ritual and were more like Steven Greer. Like many species who have an animal whose designated life goal seems to be to point out all the potential threats in the neighborhood (I'm looking at you squirrels and prairie dogs), it seems mankind itself worldwide has had individuals who were born with some sort of nearly chaotic gift of interaction with the "gods".\n\n# What can we Conclude?\n\n> Interpretating the interactions is an experience, not a form of logical thought.\n\nI think we can all say that the one thing these experiences does convince the experiencer about is that *something* exists beyond our normal physical experience of life. Despite the obfuscation, it appears that the one consistent affect these experiences have on everyone who goes through them is a shift in their understanding of the world away from materialism. It gives hope there is something more, something out there, the possibility of a baffling outer-life - and possibly an after-life. It reminds us that we are being observed, even when we think we are not. For the Christian, this gives hope that our actions - even when no person is watching - could have real rewards.	\N	\N	Is there a consistent type of communication, or language, used in paranormal phenomena?	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-08-05 23:04:28.497+00	2020-08-09 08:58:51.505+00	2	1	1	\N	t	the-seven-rules-of-supernatural-interpretation
18	Catholic Secrecy and Confusion	2020-08-03 08:00:00+00	f	\N	Diana Walsh Pasulka, in her book [American Cosmic](), spends time explaining that the UFO phenomena is well known to the Catholic Church. If you have read my Introduction and Background stories, you know that my own experience involves an experience similar to what is recorded about the famous magi in the book of Matthew who followed a "star" that "moved" in the sky to wher Jesus was born. Consider stories like [this one](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2018/07/27/close-encounters-priest-and-mysterious-ufo-sighting) or of [Father William Gill Sighting, with 26 witnesses](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/66advv/father_william_gill_talks_about_the_extraordinary/). Clearly paranormal phenomena involving flying objects, with humanoid creatures, has been happening for a long time and to people of all types of religious backgrounds. It does not seem to be localized to a particular creed or set of doctrines - even within the Christian faith.\n\nThe Vatican archives, which are miles upon miles of shelves of books, contain both ancient and modern stories of Catholic experiences of the paranormal - including UFO-style stories.  But they are off-limits to the general public. The Catholic church famously lost its battle against Protestantism in large part due to a desire to only allow elites to access information, like the text of the Bible itself. It appears that the Vatican Archives continue this tradition.	2	5	The Vatican has miles of book shelves that contain numerous stories of paranormal encounters, many of which include UFOs.

10	Finale	2020-07-21 10:00:00+00	t	\N	In the previous six posts, I explored a wild life journey with a cornucopia of paranormal events that found its end (or new beginning) at a church in Stockholm, Sweden. At this end I could legitimately say that an angel (messenger) lead me by a star to "Deliverance" from an evil presence that had haunted me for over twenty years - and it would be a valid sentence. To the intellectual, however, the entire thing was an overwhelmingly humbling and bewildering set of events.\n\nAt this point it has been over six months since the "conclusion" in the church, and I have given everything that happened plenty of thought.\n\nI became an atheist in 2009, and it was almost exactly 10 years later that I was forced back into faith. At any point during those 10 years I suppose heaven could have reached out, but they waited until 2019, almost weeks before the coronavirus started ripping through the population of the globe.\n\nMy first UFO sighting was on April 22, 2019. The Wilson Memo was leaked on April 19, 2019 a few days before. My final UFO sighting was a day or two before September 27. The U.S. Navy acknowledgement of the existence of UFOs was on September 18, 2020 - one week before. In a ten year period the final moments of my return to faith are timed almost perfectly with the Wilson Memo and the Navy Acknowledgement of UFOs:\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>When</td><td>Event</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n2008/2009</td> <td>I become an atheist, at the end of my Moody Bible education</td></tr>\n<tr><td colspan=2>...</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Oct 27, 2017</td><td>Ghost speaks to me and Rick overhears it in apartment in London</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Apr 19, 2019</td><td><a target="_blank" href="https://imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQ">Wilson Memo Leaked</a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Apr 22, 2019</td><td>My friend and I see two UFOs "arrive" in Stockholm</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Jun 7, 2019</td><td>My conversation with Rick where two angels arrive in my apartment and drive out the evil presence</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sep 18, 2019</td><td><a target="_blank" href="https://www.governing.com/news/headlines/The-US-Navy-Acknowledges-that-UFOs-Exist-for-the-First-Time--Because-Blink-182-Singer-Tom-DeLonge-Leaked-Video-the-Government-Says-He-Should-Never-Have-Had.html">U.S. Navy acknowledges existence of UFOs</a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sep 25, 2019 (appr.)</td><td>I see my final UFO that leads me to the church</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sep 30, 2019</td><td><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newlife.nu/stockholm/explore/sermons/spiritual-warfare-and-deliverance-2019.html">Finale of sermon at New Life church in Stockholm</a></td></tr>\n</table>\n\nTo be clear, I am not declaring that officially there is a direct link between the events of last year in the UFO community internationally and what happened to me, but given the timing of the events I believe that heaven reached out in conjunction with them.\n\nShortly after the last UFO lead me to the church, in early October, 2019, I sat down and was doing more looking into the UFO phenomenon and discovered the Navy leak news. Surprisingly that news was not front-page at the time, although it was widely circulated. When I discovered the timing of it, I felt overwhelming convinced my experience must be genuine. After all, the messengers from heaven must have known I would Google what was going on. If they knew that pastor was going to do that sermon, they also would have known the U.S. Navy would release their report.\n\nIn all fairness to my reader, your skepticism is healthy. Please keep it. I am still overwhelmed by how strange this all is, and am open to contact and discussion on the matter. If there is one thing I have learned about the paranormal and supernatural, it is that high strangeness prevails.\n\n> Our conscious experience of reality appears to be a plaything of the gods. UFOs, ghosts, hauntings, demon possessions, witchcraft, visions, dreams, Christianity and world religions... all of these are seemingly connected together under a bedrock of highly strange behavior.\n\nFor myself, I have taken my story as an absolute admonition to myself that Jesus was indeed sent to save the world. The use of a star to lead me to a Christian church, and the varied use of people spanning multiple denominations within the church, has given me more than enough evidence that - at the very least - this is the direction heaven has instructed me to pursue.\n\nA couple of final thoughts for this series. From a "scientific" perspective, I think it must be made clear that we seem to have a phenomena for which we know the phenotype (the visible external interaction with physical reality) but we do not have even an inkling of the genotype (the mathematical structures underlying the mechanism). **I am using the words phenotype and genotype as analogies, not as direct connections.** Speaking from a scientific and logical viewpoint, I believe at this point we can say the following about the supernatural:\n\n1. Intelligent conscious creatures exist which are interacting with human conscious experience\n2. Intelligent conscious creatures that can play with our conscious experience cannot be subjected to normal hypothesis-based scientific methods\n3. Consciousness itself seems to exist independent of physical earth-based brains\n\nNumber 3 will take some unpacking, so I will explore that in a later post. Thank you for reading, and God bless your day.\n\n	1	8	A final conclusion and my thoughts six months later.	t	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-21 21:12:20.527+00	2020-08-09 09:00:28.665+00	5	\N	1	\N	t	finale
19	Government Coverup	2020-08-03 08:00:00+00	t	\N	\nThe United States government has a long history of covering up information regarding UFOs. The data on this is abundant, as Richard Dolan points out in the following short video which I highly recommend:\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaxtKeWKPBs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDolan makes it clear the government has long been attempting to hide - or reframe - the bulk of data associated with UFO and UAP phenomena. Since at least the 1950s, it was generally assumed in the public square that the Air Force or Pentagon were hiding secret technology (akin to the F-117 or the B-2) and that most sightings could be attributed to this. While comforting to imagine the United States government is *so advanced* they have technology that rivals Star Trek, the data just does not add up. If the Department of Defense developed craft that could appear and disappear out of thin air since the 1940s, we are wasting a lot of money on hundreds of Air Force programs.\n\nUFO reports within government folklore go back at least to World War II. The reports back then involved "flying saucers", "glowing orbs", and "star-looking" objects zipping around the sky - just like today. The famous [Foo Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_fighter) were a great example of this phenomena. Then, shortly after World War II ended, there was a significant increase in UFO sightings and apparent abductions around the 1950s. In 2015, the CIA admitted that at least half of the reported sightings were indeed spy craft. But this still does not explain the other half.  Some in ufology surmised this is due to mankind developing the atomic bomb. The theory generally runs that an atomic explosion is dangerous for these beings and they want us to stop, as evidenced by unconfirmed reports that UFO craft have disabled both Russian and United States nuclear missile launch systems.\n\nBut as with most of these stories, they are often labeled as "unconfirmed". Just as in most religious experiences and occult activity reports, you and I are entirely dependent on trusting a few select witnesses. It is usual that there is little or no physical evidence. Photos or videos are blurry, or conveniently erased. We must trust that the witnesses are who they say they are and that their memory of the event is accurate. But it gets more frustrating, because in many cases the government denies or contradicts the witness testimony. Even the famous Roswell incident - which began with a newspaper article declaring that a saucer-shaped object had crashed - was quickly changed to a "weather balloon" story. Even though the original person who posed with the weather balloon has come out on record and said that it was a hoax story cooked up by the United States intelligence community, the government's status and power tend to trump a lone witness.\n\n![Roswell Newspaper Original](https://joshoncode.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/28a64ad379f44ea9951a1f654956c714.jpg)\n\n# What does "Confirmed" Mean?\n\nSo in this we learn an important lesson:\n\n> Who has the authority to confirm an experience?\n\nIf the government says "yes, that thing is not ours" it is tempting to think the government is lying. If the government contradicts a witness of an encounter, many like to side with the government out of a desire for comfort and therefore it is easier to imagine the witness to be attention-seeking or a nutcase. We learn really quickly that "unconfirmed" is no different than "unconfirmable", for even the government themselves is not trustworthy on the matter. After all, the government is made up of people who are no different at the end of the day than the witnesses themselves.\n\nI for one would like to imagine that the government has some secret archive of information, some advanced tech or access to secret knowledge that gives them some insight into what is going on. However, the data just does not completely fit this. For one, it takes an [act of Congress](https://about.bgov.com/news/congress-likely-to-follow-as-house-seeks-more-f-35s-f-15xs-2/) to keep funding the F-22 or F-35. Where would the United States be getting money and thousands of tight-lipped engineers - since the 1940s no less - to build technology that is apparently light-years ahead of our most advanced fighter plane? Do we honestly think that only a few lone souls similar to [Bob Lazar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar) are the only ones who would not squeal that we have this technology?\n\nAnd so we are left with hundreds, if not thousands, of eyewitness testimony - many times with multiple witnesses - of truly bizarre phenomena within the government bodies themselves. From men like President Jimmy Carter to air force pilots like David Frazer, the reports are wild and sometimes fantastical. Sometimes they are of glowing orbs, sometimes of stationary saucers, sometimes of star-like objects zipping across the sky and radar screens. And in the more extreme cases, there are stories of crashed craft and humanoid beings, like in the Lazar story.\n\nWhy has the government been so secretive and why now, in 2020, are they allowing a slow-drip of information to the press without trying to hush it up like they seem to have done with Roswell?\n\n# Theorizing\n\nIn 2020, we are experiencing a radical shift in the way information is shared. For one, communication is impossible without cell-phones, and all cell-phones are equipped with cameras. This goes for military personnel as well. Secondly, we are in the post-Wikileaks era where even the average teenager knows how to anonymously leak information. It could simply be that the government knows quite well that their top brass are likely to drop bombs over the next couple of decades and they want to get ahead of the game, so they are relaxing their intellectual control on the matter. This is primarily out of necessity.\n\nTime will tell, but I believe we are in for a considerable number of surprises. But remember, they may still not be telling the whole truth - no matter how fantastical it sounds.\n	2	4	UFO phenomena is shrouded in secrecy, whether it is the Vatican archives or the US government lying about their data.

11	Consciousness and Paranormal	2020-07-22 10:00:00+00	t	\N	This post will explore the strange relationship between paranormal activity and consciousness. My case is going to be that all the evidence seems to indicate that supernatural/spiritual intelligent things (I do not know what word to use to describe them) have been interacting with human conscious experience for as long as we have recorded human history and that this seems to indicate that consciousness itself exists in a medium that science does not have tools to understand. My hypothesis would be that consciousness itself is an emergent property of living beings and that its structure is in a medium (similar to a gravitational field) orthogonal to the material realm in which all of our science operates. As a result, this is why we are unable to influence consciousness itself without messing with the underlying structure - our physical brain. Just as a configuration of iron atoms can produce a magnetic field, so a configuration of neurons (or other substructures in our living brain) can produce a conscious "field".\n\nBefore I begin, I feel it best if I give a little background on the material I have read. I have a fairly strong understanding of evolutionary science, evolutionary psychology, and the more modern thinking around the differences between the biological studies of consciousness and what has been coined the hard problem of consciousness. I recognize that neurons play a role in consciousness, that the effects of drugs - particularly psychadelics - on consciousness indicate a material basis for spiritual emotions, and that scientists are fast on track to understanding how our consciousness can be turned on or off via anesthesia. Recent studies have gone as far as to attempt to pinpoint the exact mechanism that turns consciousness or off. It is not a bad proposal that science is fast on track to identifying a material source of consciousness, and I generally agree.\n\nThere is a clear distinction between neuronal activity and the qualia of consciousness. Red and redness can be distinguished from eachother. Red is a particular band in the electromagnetic spectrum *and* redness is the subjective experience that I - or you - experience when we see a red thing. However, it is impossible to compare the subjective experience itself. The red I see might not be experienced by you the same way. If I were to ask you what red is to you, the only way you can show me is if you grab a red thing and show it to me. Of course, I will also see it as red, but the qualia of our experience is impossible to describe without an external prop. So it is impossible to compare qualia unless I could simultaneously experience my own and your subjective qualia simultaneously - and how would I prove that I had actually done this without encountering the same problem!\n\nThere is a strong correlation between human and animal consciousness that lends consciousness to a material origin. We all sleep, dream, have the same types of senses (in various degrees), and react to many drugs in a similar fashion. It is reasonable to conclude that a horse that eats magic mushrooms is probably tripping balls and consciously swimming in a sea of chaotic but beautiful qualia - just like Woodstock did. Religious arguments about humans having a unique soul - or unique conscious experience of the world - seem to fall flat on the surface. Studies have gone further to show that even our human conscious experience of the world might differ in large part between human individuals. Color blindness, it seems, is not the only way in which we can experience the world differently through our senses. It appears that these differences might go so far as to extend to our entire internal experience of the world through emotions and subtle sensations. Conditions like synesthesia, for example, indicate that neuronal structure can construct an entirely new set of sensations that others may never be able to experience. Consequently, all of these seems to suggest that conscious qualia themselves might be a combination of phenotypes influenced by our genetic makeup.\n\nIn short, the hard problem of consciousness is our inability to identify and reproduce the source of conscious qualia. The difficulty runs so deep that some like Daniel Dennett have staked a large portion of their research on the argument that consciousness itself appears to be an illusion. The best evidence for this in my opinion are scientific experiments that observe a person's brain waves while they observe something. Scientists then measure the time gap between when the person's brain waves indicate a thing happened and when the person says it happened. The neurons seem to fire before the person says they experienced the event. If we assume causality, this is good evidence that neurons *cause* conscious qualia.\n\n> Then why, in heavens name, do so many paranormal experiences - even with thousands of simultaneous observers - seem to indicate another conscious being is influencing or playing directly with the qualia of the observer while skipping the physical realm entirely? It is as if these beings are capable of bypassing the normal physical realm to get directly at our subjective experience - thereby leaving no physical traces in the observable physical world.\n\nIron atoms, when aligned in tandom, produce a magnetic field that extends far beyond the distance of the strong magnetic force. However, this does not imply that iron atoms *cause* a magnetic field. One could argue they are simply distorting a neutral field that already exists everywhere. And it would be absurd to propose that iron atoms are the *only thing* that can distort this magnetic field. The field itself is in a medium independent of iron atoms. My proposal is that consciousness itself is similar to the magnetic field. Our neurons can produce a "bubble" in this consciousness field (I picture a ball in a bedsheet like those gravity examples), but it is possible for this field of consciousness to be influenced by something else. Smacking a magnet with a hammer can cause the magnetic field to change by jostling the iron atom alignment. So smacking a brain with a hammer will cause the conscious field to change by messing with the neuron activity. However, that does not mean that the magnetic field is only or entirely produced by the iron atoms. And this therefore means that consciousness itself might not only be produced by neurons. It is through this other undiscovered medium that I propose all paranormal phenomena originates, including UFOs.\n\nIt is worth noting that this theory allows for the simultaneous existence of mental illness and "spiritual" external influence. If our conscious qualia exist in a bubble in a scientifically unknown medium that also can be influenced by other undiscovered mediums, then poor configuration of our neurons *and* external "spiritual" activity can screw with our conscious experience. Your depression could be caused by *both* physical ailment and a "spiritual" problem simultaneously. And this would be predicted by this model.\n\nJust as the magnetic field can be influenced by things other than just atoms, so this model would make it possible for the conscious field to be influenced by things other than genetically-based physical living creatures on earth. If there were multiple worlds or universes, why could there not be other more advanced beings in these other universes that share - or able to cross into - our conscious field?\n\nIt might be good to give some examples. In my ghost story Rick and myself heard a disembodied sound. He heard a strange "utterance" or "whooshing" or "breath"  (his words) sound, while I heard a distinct female voice. In the story of Fatima, thousands of observers saw a terrifying sight of the sun "dancing", but their qualia seemed to range from just colors changing to the sun falling from heaven. Even in the Bible, this strange phenomena occurs. In one case a voice from heaven is heard, but others nearby said they only heard thunder. Thousands of stories within Christendom talk about people who *hear* a person speaking in a language that the other person did not know. In Diana's book, a couple had a simultaneous angelic encounter but the two of them describe seeing a different shape in the same location. I could go on, but hopefully this is enough to wet your appetite.\n\nThis theory opens up an entire world of possibilities. It would imply that there could be incredible ways to influence conscious creatures that we cannot even imagine. Symbols, imagery, and even unremembered dreams could play a role in our conscious experience of this world. It also implies that it might be possible to maintain a conscious structure in this medium independent of the existence of our body. If we extrapolate this playful idea out, just as we can do so much with electromagnetic fields, technology or living beings that exist that are more advanced, complex, or powerful in this conscious medium might have capabilities that we cannot even possibly comprehend. Qualia could be to them as physical objects are to us.\n\nThere is nothing to indicate that consciousness in this field would be localized to physical objects, either. Just as atoms can be entangled and influence eachother at great distance, indicating that there is a medium through which information can be "transferred" that does not involve a wave-form medium like light or soundwaves, so one could postulate that conscious beings could be intertwined in some way through this medium. The mechanism for this, of course, would not be known. But this would explain why both humans - and animals - have so many instances of an awareness of the death of a loved one even at great distances.\n\nNow, with this background, it would be foolish to fill our gaps of knowledge with a particular "God". Just because we do not know where consciousness comes from, does not mean that we are allowed to fill the knowledge vacuum with our favorite spiritual explanation. I am tackling this from a philosophical and admittedly pseudoscientific perspective. This is just a playground of ideas, I am not proposing this is true, it is just the best explanation I have been able to conjure up to help myself understand at this time.	\N	\N	Is consciousness a bubble in a medium we have not yet discovered?	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	2020-07-22 17:56:44.749+00	2020-08-09 09:00:22.135+00	\N	\N	1	\N	t	consciousness-and-paranormal

1	Passport to Magonia: from Folklore to Flying Saucers	\N	When I began studying religion, I was faced with a plethora of seemingly historical reports from all ages and all cultures of fantastical paranormal phenomena with scant physical evidence. After a little digging, it became clear to me that in order to remain honest, one either needed to reject all of the reports as psychological error on the part of the observer or - to my scientific horror - they are all potentially "real".\n\nIn Passport to Magonia, Jacques addresses this dilemma without reservation, giving us a tour de force through history of the strangest encounters between humans and the supernatural and/or extraterrestrial craft and beings. Despite the divergence in the qualia (the conscious way each individual experiences something) of the events, Jacques makes a strong case that the similar patterns between the encounters indicates a common source or technology across history. You might ask, how are stories of encounters with the gods in Judaism and other ancient near eastern cultures, medieval reports of gnomes, fairies, or changelings who steal or swap children, and the modern UFO and UAP phenoma connected?\n\nJacques tells stories of beings that took pancakes form a confused farmer and of a unit of soldiers who disappeared into an ominous cloud mistaken for fog and were never heard of again. He recounts the medieval story of a beautiful and moral woman who was hounded sexually by a demonic creature that would shapeshift to try and seduce her and eventually built a mound of bricks around her bed with her husband still in it. The bricks disappear the next day, after being removed and piled in a corner, confounding an entire church parish. Some of the stories are so ludicrous, it makes one feel like these beings are capable of shifting the entire substrata of the cosmos to their will - whether for good or evil.\n\nIn Angels or Devils, the book explores that although many incidents are pleasant - or even bizarrely neutral - in their narrative, some of them are ominous and exhibit all the traits of standard witchcraft or occult activity. In fact, in multiple places Jacques stops himself to declare that to go further would be diving straight into the practices of occult rituals and that is not the subject of the book. But for the curious reader, it leaves open a door that is even larger than one can imagine. It is for this reason, I believe, that so many people who have experiences show deep interest in spiritual, religious, or occult activity. Jacques' hypothesis is that they are all one and the same.\n\n**Quite simply, Jacques makes the case all of these phenomena are connected because of the ways in which they influence humans, particularly our consciousness.** Waxing philosophical in between story after story that will make you question your understanding of reality, Jacques points out that most of the personal encounters with strange craft or beings include a mixture of both physical and psychical effects. If physical evidence remains after an encounter, it is usually useless for examination using our traditional methods. But the best evidence is the way the encounters influence the minds of people, often in groups.	5	passport-to-magonia	\N	\N	One of the earliest books exploring the connections between modern UFO phenomena, religion, the occult, and folklore.

1	Over 100 years ago, Ramon y Cajal hypothesized that two forces played a role in the evolution of mammalian brain connectivity: minimizing wiring costs and maximizing conductivity speed. Using diffusion MRI, we reconstructed the brain connectomes of 123 mammalian species. Network analysis revealed that both connectivity and the wiring cost are conserved across mammals. We describe a conservation principle that maintains the overall connectivity: species with fewer interhemispheric connections exhibit better intrahemispheric connectivity.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0641-7	\N	Conservation of brain connectivity and wiring across the mammalian class	\N	2020-07-23 11:47:25.267+00	2020-07-23 11:47:25.267+00	\N	\N	\N

1	Jacques	Vallée	A computer scientists, inventor, genius communicator, and one of the most respected scientific people in both philosophy and the paranormal.	Well known for his talks, interviews, and books on UFO encounters, Jacques has earned a reputation as one of the most quoted people in the discussion on UFOs.\n\nHe is regularly quoted for pointing out the connecting patterns between ancient stories from the ANE (Ancient Near Eastern) stories of gods coming down and stealing women to the middle-ages concept and folklore regarding faires and changelings who would make deals and play tricks with humans.\n\nHis main conclusion, after dozens of years researching thousands of stories is that there is an intelligence behind UFO encounters, that UFO encounters are tightly tied to occult and religious experiences, and that these serve as a form of a control mechanism guiding human affairs.	\N	\N	jacques-vallee	t	\N	\N	\N	1	1	2020-08-09 07:37:31.269+00	2020-08-09 07:37:31.293+00

1	Things were not so simple, though, when serious research was undertaken to uncover the real history of the phenomenon. The American press may have invented modern flying saucers, but there were historical analogues to the observations reported in the States. Isolated, marginal researchers like Charles Fort in New York had uncovered anomalous sightings by astronomers in records dating back to the 19th century; stories of celestial wonders could be found in the archives of medieval writers and even those of the Roman historians.	\N	\N	Things were not so simple, though, when serious research was undertaken to uncover the real history of the phenomenon.	1	Foreword	1	1	2020-08-09 07:57:12.304+00	2020-08-09 07:57:12.314+00
6	That there is the strange beings' peculiarly insistent desire to get hold of terrestrial objects: flora and fauna. The stories quoted in this connection verge on the ludicrous. But to pursue the investigation further leads to horror. This is a facet of the phenomenon we can no longer ignore...\n\nTo the well-known question that figures in almost every UFO questionnaire, "How was your attention called to the object?", one frequently finds the answer: "My dogs seemed terrified." "There was a commotion among the cattle." "All the dogs in the neighborhood started acting madly."	\N	\N	But to pursue the investigation further leads to horror.

4	The Japanese peasants had the disagreeable tendency to interpret the "signs from heaven" as strong indications that their revolts and demands against the feudal system or against foreign invaders were just, and as assurance that their rebellions would be crowned with success... For instance, on September 12, 1271, the famous priest Nichiren was about to be beheaded at Tatsunokuchi, Kamakura, when there appeared in the sky an object like a full moon, shiny and bright. Needless to say the officials panicked and the execution was not carried out.	\N	\N	The Japanese peasants had the disagreeable tendency to interpret the "signs from heaven" as strong indications that their revolts and demands against the feudal system or against foreign invaders were just...	1	Sorcerers from the Clouds	1	1	2020-08-09 08:21:57.743+00	2020-08-09 08:21:57.75+00
5	What matters here is the link between certain unusual phenomena - observed or imagined - and the alternation of the witnesses' behavior. In other words, these accounts show that it is possible to affect the lives of many people by showing them displays that are beyond their comprehension, or by convincing them that they have observed such phenomena, or by keeping alive the belief that their destiny is somehow controlled by occult forces.	\N	\N	What matters here is the link between certain unusual phenomena - observed or imagined - and the alternation of the witnesses' behavior.	1	Sorcerer from the Clouds	1	1	2020-08-09 08:24:49.844+00	2020-08-09 08:24:49.85+00
